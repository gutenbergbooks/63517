<p>The above-named Publication is well known as the best and
most valuable one devoted to the Photographic Science in this
country. <span class="smcap">Humphrey's Journal</span> made its first appearance Nov.
1st, 1850, and consequently is the first and oldest serial offered to
the Photographic world.</p>

<p>The art of producing Portraits and Landscapes by means of
Light has recently taken a new and enlivening impulse, which
will in all probability lead to important and interesting results.
No practical Daguerreotypist, Photographer, or amateur should be
without the means at hand for securing all of the information upon
this subject. Each should be ready to receive and apply the improvements
as they may be developed. In order to accomplish this,
it is a matter of great importance to the Practitioner or Experimenter
that he should have a <i>reliable</i> medium through which he can
obtain <i>information</i>. In what source can the inquirer better place
his confidence than in a regular Journal, whose editor is literally
a <i>practical</i> person, and familiar with the manipulations necessary
for producing Portraits upon "<i>Daguerreotype Plates</i>," and upon
glass and paper? Such is the conductor of <span class="smcap">Humphrey's Journal</span>.</p>

<p>This Journal is published once every two weeks, and contains
all the improvements relating to the Art, and is the only American
Journal whose editor is <i>practically acquainted</i> with the process
for producing <i>Daguerreotypes</i>. <i>Ambrotypes</i>, and <i>Photographs</i>
The first No. of Vol. VIII is dated May 1st, 1856. The terms
(Two Dollars per annum) are trifling compared with the vast
amount of information furnished.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[-ii-]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several societies recently established in Europe composed
of learned and scientific men, who are in every way engaged
in investigating the Science, and we may look for improvement
from that quarter, as well as from our numerous resources at home.
In the former case our facilities for early and reliable information
cannot well be surpassed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ambrotypes.</span>&mdash;<i>Humphrey's Journal</i> contains everything novel
which appears upon this subject, and has already presented more
new, important; and original matter than can be found in any
other place.</p>

<p>Many are the letters we have received during the term of the
last volume, in which the writer has stated that a single number
of <span class="smcap">Humphrey's Journal</span> has contained information of more value
to him than "several times the amount paid for the entire volume."</p>

<p>Our resources have grown up around us, and our facilities for
procuring, as well as distributing, all such facts and improvements
as will benefit as well as instruct all who have the progress of
the Art at heart, are as ample as they can well be made.</p>

<p>The future volumes will be abundantly furnished with original
writings from persons of standing in the scientific world; and the
practical Photographer will here find a full account of such improvements
as may from time to time develope themselves.</p>

<p>From the Editor's long practical experience in the Heliographic
Science, he will be enabled to present the subject in a plain, clear
and concise manner.</p>

<p>The rapid and unexpected sale of the entire second edition of
this Manual has induced the author to lay the Third Edition
before the Public. Although but little time has elapsed since
the second, yet there have been some new developments which it
has been thought best to give, as conducive to the interests of the
practitioner. The manipulations have been given somewhat more
in detail than in the Second Edition.</p>

<p>All that would have a tendency to confuse the reader has been
carefully avoided, and only the plain methods for operating laid
down. The work is intended for the beginner in the glass process
of producing Heliographic pictures.</p>

<p>The object of this little <span class="smcap">Manual</span> is to present, in as plain, clear
and concise a manner as possible, the <i>practice</i> of a <span class="smcap">Collodion
Process</span>. This beautiful acquisition to a "sun-pencilling" was first
given to the public by Mr. <span class="smcap">Frederick Scott Archer</span>, an English
gentleman, who alone is entitled to the credit, and deserves the
esteem of every lover and practitioner of the Art, for his liberality
in <i>giving</i> it to the world.</p>

<p>The Process here presented has never before appeared in print,
and has been practised with the most eminent success by those who
have been enabled to adopt it.</p>

<p>All reference to the various systems or methods of manipulation,
by the thousands of practitioners, has been excluded, and one
Process given. I conceived that this was the better plan to adopt,
thus leaving the mind of the learner free from confusion, and
pointing out one course, which, if carefully followed, will produce
good and pleasing results.</p>

<p>I have also presented a list of all Patents upon the Collodion
Process; this will give all an opportunity of choosing their own
course in regard to the respect they may conceive to be due to such
Patent Rights.</p>

Various modifications it undergoes at the surfaces and the
interior of terrestrial substances.</p>

<p>Light is white and colorless, as long as it does not come in
contact with matter. When in apposition with anybody it
suffers variable degrees of decomposition, resulting in
color, as, by reflection, dispersion, refraction and unequal
absorption.</p>

<p>To Sir I. Newton the world is indebted for proving the
compound nature of a ray of white light emitted from the
sun. The object of this work is not to engage in an extended
theory upon the subject of light, but to recur only
to some points-of more particular interest to the photographic
operator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRISM, SOLAR SPECTRUM.</div>

<p>The decomposition of a beam of light can be noticed by
exposing it to a prism. If, in a dark room, a beam of light
be admitted through a small hole in a shutter 7 it will form
a white round spot upon the place where it falls. If a triangular
prism of glass be placed on the inside of the
dark room, so that the beam of light falls upon it, it no
longer has the same direction, nor does it form a round spot,
but an oblong painted image of seven colors&mdash;red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. This is called the
solar spectrum, and will be readily understood by reference
to the accompanying diagram, <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 440px;"><a id="Fig_1"></a>

</div>

<p>To those who are unacquainted with the theory of light
(and for their benefit this chapter is given), it may be a
matter of wonder how a beam of light can be divided.
This can be understood when I say, that white light is a
bundle of colored rays united together, and when so incorporated,
they are colorless; but in passing <i>through</i> the prism
the bond of union is severed, and the colored rays come
out <i>singly</i> and <i>separately</i>, because each ray has a certain
amount of refracting (bending) power, peculiar to itself.
These rays always hold the same relation to each other,
as may be seen by comparing every spectrum or rainbow;
there is never any confusion or misplacement.</p>

<p>There are various other means of decomposing white
light besides the prism, of which one of the principal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[-15-]</a></span>
most interesting to the photographer, is by <i>reflection</i> from
colored bodies. If a beam of white light falls upon a white
surface, it is reflected without change; but if it falls upon a
<i>red</i> surface, only the red ray is reflected: so also with yellow
and other colors; the ray which is reflected corresponds
with the color of the object. It is this reflected decomposed
light which presents the beautifully colored image we see
upon the ground glass in our cameras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIGHT, HEAT, AND ACTINISM.</div>

<p>A sunbeam may be capable of three divisions&mdash;<span class="smcap">light</span>,
<span class="smcap">heat</span>, and <span class="smcap">actinism</span>; the last causes all the chemical changes,
and is the acting power upon surfaces prepared to receive
the photographic image. The accompanying illustration,
<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, will readily bring to the minds of the reader the
relation of these one to another, and their intensities in
the different parts of a decomposed sunbeam.</p>

<p>The various points of the solar spectrum are represented
in the order in which they occur between <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[-16-]</a></span>
exhibits the limits of the Newtonian spectrum, corresponding
with <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>. Sir John Herschel and Seebeck have
shown that there exists, beyond the violet, a faint violet
light, or rather a <i>lavender</i>, to <i>b</i>, which gradually becomes
colorless; similarly, red light exists beyond the assigned
limits of the red ray to <i>a</i>. The greatest amount of actinic
power is shown at <span class="smcap">E</span> opposite the violet; hence this color
"exerts" the greatest amount of influence in the formation
of the photographic image.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLORING WALLS BLUE.</div>

<p>(Blue paper and blue color have been somewhat extensively
used by our operators in their operating rooms and
skylights, in order to facilitate the operation in the camera.
I fancy, however, that this plan cannot be productive
of as much good as thought by some, from the fact, that
the light falling upon the subject, and then reflected into
the camera, is, coming through colorless glass, not
affected by such rays as may be reflected from the walls
of the operating room; and even if it were so, I conceive
that it would be injurious, by destroying the harmony of
Shadows which might otherwise occur.) The greatest
amount of white light is at <span class="smcap">C</span>; the yellow contains less of
the chemical power than any Other portion of the solar
Spectrum. It has been found that the most intense heat
is at the <i>Extreme Red</i>, <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Artificial lights differ in their color; the white light of
turning charcoal, which is the principal light from candles,
oil and gas, contains three fays&mdash;red, yellow and blue. The
dazzling light emitted from lime intensely heated, known
as the <i>Drummond light</i>, gives the color of the prism almost
as bright as the solar spectrum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIGHT, HEAT, AND CHEMICAL POWER.</div>

<p>If we expose a prepared collodionized plate or sensitive
paper to the solar spectrum, it will be observed that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[-17-]</a></span>
luminous power (the yellow) occupies but a small space
compared with the influence of heat and chemical power.
R. Hunt, in his <i>Researches on Light</i>, has presented the
following remarks upon the accompanying illustration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 393px;"><a id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="393" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>"If the linear measure, or the diameter of a circle which
shall include the luminous rays, is 25, that of the calorific
spectrum will be 42·10, and of the chemical spectrum 55·10.
Such a series of circles may well be used to represent a
beam from the sun, which may be regarded as an atom of
<i>Light</i> surrounded with an invisible atmosphere of <i>Heat</i>, and
another still more extended, which possesses the remarkable
property of producing chemical and molecular change."</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFRACTION.</div>

<p>A ray of light, in passing obliquely through any medium
of uniform density, does not change its course; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[-18-]</a></span>
if it should pass into a denser body, it would turn from a
straight line, pursue a less oblique direction, and in a line
nearer to a perpendicular to the surface of that body. Water
exerts a stronger refracting power than air; and if a
ray of light fall upon a body of this fluid its course is
changed, as may be seen by reference to <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>. It is
observed that it proceeds in a less oblique direction (towards
the dotted line), and, on passing on through, leaves
the liquid, proceeding in a line parallel to that which it
entered. It should be observed, that at the <i>surface</i> of
bodies the refractive power is exerted, and that the light
proceeds in a straight line until leaving the body. The
refraction is more or less, and in all cases in proportion as
the rays fall more or less obliquely on the refracting surface.
It is this law of optics which has given rise to the
lenses in our camera tubes, by which means we are enabled
to secure a well-delineated representation of any object
we choose to picture.</p>

<p>When a ray of light passes from one medium to another,
and through that into the first again, if the two refractions
be equal, and in opposite directions, no sensible effect will
be produced.</p>

<p>The reader may readily comprehend the phenomena of
refraction, by means of light passing through lenses of different
curves, by reference to the following diagrams:&mdash;</p>

these it is seen that a double-convex lens tends to
condense the rays of light to a focus, a double-concave to
scatter them, and a concavo-convex combines both powers.</p>

<p>If parallel rays of light fall upon a double-convex lens,
D D, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>, they will be refracted (excepting such as pass
directly through the centre) to a point termed the principal
focus. The lines A B C represent parallel rays which
pass through the lens D D, and meet at F; this point being
the principal focus, its distance from the lens is called the
<i>focal length</i>. Those rays of light which are traversing a
<i>parallel</i> course, when they enter the lens are brought to a
focus nearer the lens than others. Hence the difficulty
the operator sometimes experiences by not being able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[-20-]</a></span>
"obtain a focus," when he wishes to secure a picture of
some very distant objects; he does not get his <i>ground
glass near enough to the lenses</i>. Again, the rays from an
object near by may be termed diverging rays. This will
be better comprehended by reference to <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>, where it
will be seen that the dotted lines, representing parallel
rays meet nearer the lenses than those from the point A.
The closer the object is to the lenses, the greater will be
the divergence. This rule is applicable to copying, Did
we wish to copy a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> size daguerreotype on a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> size
plate, we would place it in such a position to the lenses
at A, that the focus would be at F, where the image
would be represented at about the proper size. Now, if
we should wish to copy the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> size picture, and produce
another of exactly the same dimensions, we have only to
bring it nearer to the lenses, so that the lens D E shall be
equi-distant from the picture and the focus, <i>i. e.</i> from A to
B. The reason of this is, that the distance of the picture
from the lens, in the last copy, is less than the other, and
the divergence has increased, throwing the focus further
from the lens.</p>

<p>These remarks have been introduced here as being important
for those who may not understand the principles
of enlarging or reducing pictures in copying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[-21-]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LENSES.</div>

<p>I would remark that the points F and A, in Fig. 9, are
termed "conjugate foci."</p>

<p>If we hold a double-convex lens opposite any object,
we find that an inverted image of that object will be
formed on a paper held behind it. To illustrate this more
clearly, I will refer to the following wood-cut:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 399px;"><a id="Fig_10"></a>
<img src="images/fig10.png" width="399" height="207" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 10.</div>
</div>

<p>"If A B C is an object placed before a convex lens,
L L, every point of it will send forth rays in all directions;
but, for the sake of simplicity, suppose only three
points to give out rays, one at the top, one at the middle,
and one at the bottom; the whole of the rays then that
proceed from the point A, and fall on the lens L L, will
be refracted and form an image somewhere on the line
A G E, which is drawn direct through the centre of the
lens; consequently the focus E, produced by the convergence
of the rays proceeding from A, must form an image
of A, only in a different relative position; the middle
point of C, being in a direct line with the axis of the lens,
will have its image formed on the axis F, and the rays
proceeding from the point B will form an image at D; so
that by imagining luminous objects to be made up of an
infinite number of radiating points, and the rays from each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[-22-]</a></span>
individual point, although falling on the whole surface of
the lens, to converge again and form a focus or representation
of that point from which the rays first emerged, it
will be very easy to comprehend how images are formed,
and the cause of those images being reversed.</p>

<p>"It must also be evident, that in the two triangles
A G B and D G E, that E D, the length of the image,
must be to A B, the length of the object, as G D, the distance
of the image, is to G B, the distance of the object
from the lens."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPHERICAL ABERRATION.</div>

<p>It will be observed, that in the last cut the image produced
by the lens is curved. Now, it would be impossible
to produce a well-defined image from the centre to
the edge upon a <i>plain</i> surface; the outer edges would
be misty, indistinct, or crayon-like. The centre of the
image might be represented clear and sharp on the ground
glass, yet this would be far from the case in regard to the
outer portions. This is called <i>spherical aberration</i>, and to
it is due the want of distinctness which is frequently
noticed around the edges of pictures taken in the camera.
To secure a camera with a <i>flat, sharp field</i>, should be the
object of every Operator; and, in a measure, this constitutes
the great difference in cameras manufactured in this
country.</p>

<p>Spherical aberration is overcome by proper care in the
formation of the lens:&mdash;"It can be shown upon mathematical
data that a lens similar to that given in the following
diagram&mdash;one surface of which is a section of an
ellipse, and the other of a circle struck from the furthest
of the two foci of that ellipse&mdash;produces no aberration.</p>

<p>"At the earliest period of the employment of the camera
obscura, a <i>double-convex</i> lens was used to produce the image;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[-23-]</a></span>
but this form was soon abandoned, on account of the spherical
aberration so caused. Lenses for the photographic
camera are now always ground of a concavo-convex form,
or meniscus, which corresponds more nearly to the accompanying
diagram."</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 208px;"><a id="Fig_11"></a>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 11.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHROMATIC ABERRATION.</div>

<p><i>Chromatic Aberration</i> is another difficulty that opticians
have to contend with in the manufacturing of lenses. It will
be remembered, that in a former page (<a href="#Page_14">14</a>) a beam of
light is decomposed by passing through a glass prism giving
seven distinct colors&mdash;<i>red</i>, <i>orange</i>, <i>yellow</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>blue</i>,
<i>indigo</i> and <i>violet</i>.</p>

<p>Now, as has been said before, the dissimilar rays having an
unequal degree of refrangibility, it will be impossible to obtain
a focus by the light passing through a double-convex
lens without its being fringed with color. Its effect will be
readily understood by reference to the accompanying cut.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 328px;"><a id="Fig_12"></a>
<img src="images/fig12.png" width="328" height="121" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 12.</div>
</div>

<p>If L L be a double convex-lens, and R R R parallel rays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[-24-]</a></span>
of white light, composed of the seven colored rays, each
having a different <i>index</i> of refraction, they cannot be
refracted to one and the same point; the red rays, being
the least refrangible, will be bent to <i>r</i>, and the violet rays,
being the most refrangible, to <i>v</i>: the distance <i>v r</i> constitutes
the chromatic aberration, and the circle, of which the
diameter is <i>a l</i>, the place or point of mean refraction, and
is called the circle of least aberration. If the rays of the
sun are refracted by means of a lens, and the image
received on a screen placed between C and <i>o</i>, so as to cut
the cone L <i>a l</i> L, a luminous circle will be formed on the
paper, only surrounded by a red border, because it is produced
by a section of the cone L <i>a l</i> L, of which the external
rays L <i>a</i> L <i>l</i>, are red; if the screen be moved to the
other side of <i>o</i>, the luminous circle will be bordered with
violet, because it will be a section of the cone M <i>a</i> M <i>l</i>, of
which the exterior rays are violet. To avoid the influence
of spherical aberration, and to render the phenomena of
coloration more evident, let an opaque disc be placed over
the central portion of the lens, so as to allow the rays only
to pass which are at the edge of the glass; a violet image
of the sun will then be seen at <i>v</i>, red at <i>r</i>, and, finally,
images of all the colors of the spectrum in the intermediate
space; consequently, the general image will not
only be confused, but clothed with prismatic colors.</p>

<p>To overcome the difficulty arising from the chromatic
aberration, the optician has only to employ a combination
of lenses of opposite focal length, and cut from glass possessing
different refrangible powers, so that the rays of light
passing through the one are strongly refracted, and in
the other are bent asunder again, reproducing white light.</p>

<p>To the photographer one of the most important features,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[-25-]</a></span>
requiring his particular attention, is, that he be provided
with a good lens. By the remarks given in the preceding
pages, he will be enabled, in a measure, to judge of some
of the difficulties to which he is <i>occasionally</i> subjected.
We have in this country but two or three individuals who
are giving their attention to the manufacture of lenses,
and their construction is such, that they are quite free
from the <i>spherical</i> or <i>chromatic aberration</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Babtista Porta</span>, when he saw for the first time, on the
walls of his dark chamber, the images of external nature,
pictured by a sunbeam which found its way through only
a small hole, little thought of the importance which would
be attached to the instrument he was, from this cause, led
to invent. The camera obscura of this Italian philosopher
remained as a mere scientific toy for years, and it was not
until Daguerre's discovery that its true value was estimated.
It now plays a very important part in giving
employment to at least <i>ten thousand persons</i> in this country
alone.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance, in selecting a set of apparatus,
to secure a good camera; for without such no one
can obtain fine pictures. In testing it, see that it gives
the pupil of the eye and lineaments of the features sharp
and distinct; and that the whole image on the ground
glass has a fine pearly hue. Look also to the field, and
observe that the focus is good at the centre and extreme
edges of the ground glass, at the same time. A poor camera
generally gives a misty image, with the lights and
shades apparently running together. The best American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[-27-]</a></span>

much less; but there are great numbers sold which are

<div class="sidenote">CAMERA TUBES AND LENSES.</div>

<p>If a lens gives a well defined image on the ground glass,
it should do the same on the plate. Many a valuable lens
has been condemned for failing in this, merely in consequence
of the plate-holder not being in focus with the
ground-glass. In case of deficiency in this, put a glass
into the holder, lay a rule across the face, and measure the
distance between them very exactly; measure the ground-glass
in the same way, and make the distance agree perfectly,
by moving the ground-glass either back or forward
in the frame, as the case may be, so that the surface of the
glass plate shall occupy precisely the same position as the
face of the ground-glass when in the camera.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POSITION OF LENSES IN THE TUBE.</div>

<p>It is very desirable that the operator should understand
the arrangement of the lenses in the tube; it not unfrequently
happens, that in taking out the "glasses" to
clean them, he does not return them to their proper places,
and the result is that his "camera is spoiled." A couple of
illustrations and a few remarks will be sufficient to enable
any one to replace the lenses in them properly. <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>
represents the tube for holding the lens, and <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>
shows their arrangement. It will be seen that the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[-28-]</a></span>
back lenses have a small space between them; this separation
is kept by a small tube or ring of the same circumference
as the lens. The two front lenses are nearest together.
It will be observed that the two thick lenses are
towards each other; these are made of <i>flint glass</i> containing
much oxide of lead. The other two are double convex,
and are made of <i>crown glass</i>. By noting the fact that the
two cemented lenses go in the front of the tube, the
glass having the thickest edge goes inside, and that the
<i>thickest lens</i> of the other two goes in first, from the back of
the tube, it will not be easy for the operator to make a
mistake in returning the "glasses."</p>

<p>"I will remark that a diaphragm diminishes both chromatic
and spherical aberration, by cutting off the outside
portion of the lens. It lessens the brilliancy of the image,
but improves the distinctness by preventing various rays
from interfering with and confusing each other; it also
causes a variety of objects at different distances to be in
focus at the same time."</p>

<p>There are several patterns of these; almost every

for his interest, suits his purposes best. Among the assortment,
I will present only two illustrations. The first, <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>,
represents one which has an advantage over many
others; it is made of cast iron, and of an ornamental
pattern:&mdash;A, base on castors; B, fluted hollow column, which
admits the iron tube C, which has on one side a hollow
tooth rack to receive a spiral thread on the inner face of
wheel D; this wheel, when turned, elevates or lowers the

tube C to any desired height; E, thumb wheel attached
to a screw which sets against tube C, to hold it in position,
F, a pinion by which the camera can be directed;
G G, thumb screws to hold the two plates together when
in position. It is quite heavy, stands <i>firm</i> and <i>solid</i>, and
is not liable to be moved by the jar from walking over
the floor. For permanently located operators these are
the most desirable; but for those who are moving about
from place to place, and those who wish to take views, a
lighter article would be more convenient, such as one
represented at <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>. This stand is made principally of
wood, and can be readily taken apart, so as to be packed
in an ordinary sized trunk.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration, <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, <i>a</i>, represents a
bath for holding the nitrate of silver solution. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[-35-]</a></span>
shape is of my own suggestion, and the best adapted
to the wants of the photographer. It will be seen that the
front side is rounding, with a curve extending from side to
side. By this shape, the <i>face</i> of the glass is protected from
coming in contact with the side of the bath&mdash;both edges
of it turning so as to prevent injury. There is a small
projection on the top, at the opposite side of the oval;
this is to allow the solution to flow over and wash off any
dust that may have gathered upon the surface of the solution.
This wash runs out of a small tube, as is shown in
the cut. Any convenient vessel can be placed under it to
receive the liquid. This can be filtered and returned as
often as required. I am not in the practice of filling my
baths full of solution, but always keep them filtered and
clean; hence saving an excess of solution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINTING FRAMES.</div>

<p>There are numerous methods and apparatus used for
holding the negative and the paper during exposure to the
light. The following illustrations represent a convenient
and economical frame for this purpose.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a> represents the front of the frame. The negative
glass is held upon it by springs attached by screws to the
bottom half of the frame, A, so that they can be
turned on or off, to suit the different sizes of glass. On
the other end of the spring are wooden buttons, which are
placed on the edges of the glass negative, holding it in its
place, and pressing it firmly against the paper which is
placed under it. This frame is made of two pieces of
inch board, which are connected by hinges, falling over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[-37-]</a></span>
as seen in <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>, B being the half that is movable. This
movable half is secured in position by means of a wooden
button, attached to A on the back and under B, as seen in
<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>. The separate pieces, A and B, are bevelled where
they connect, as seen by <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>. D (in <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>) is one of
the springs, which can be seen in <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>.</p>

<p>The entire bed or face of the frame, A and B, should be
covered with a thick piece of satinet cloth, which may be
pasted to the lower half, A, and extended over the entire
surface of A and B. This forms a pad for the paper.</p>

<p>This printing frame can be easily made by any cabinet-maker
or carpenter. The springs may be of sheet iron or
brass&mdash;either will be found sufficiently stiff for the purpose.
Every operator should be provided with from four to ten
frames: the saving of time will be found to amply repay
the expenditure necessary for a good supply.</p>

<p>Another article called a pressure frame, is represented in
the accompanying figure. This is more expensive than
the first, and is by some considered preferable.</p>

<p>Another cheap, convenient and equally good arrangement
for holding the negative and paper, is to take three
glasses&mdash;say one a full size, being the one having the negative
upon it; and then take two glasses, each just half the
size of the negative, and have a piece of <i>very thick heavy</i>
cloth cut the size of the negative glass, which can be put
between it and the two half glasses, and then they can be
held together by means of the common spring clothes pin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[-38-]</a></span>
The advantage of the two glasses at the back is, that one
can be entirely removed while the picture is being examined,
and afterwards returned without, in the least,
moving the impression.</p>

<p>The chemistry of Photography requires the attention,
in a greater or less degree, of every practitioner. It is of
the utmost importance, that those who wish to meet with
success in the various processes given, should not only be
provided with a good selection of chemicals, but also understand
the nature of the agent employed. To give a
perfectly complete and full list of every agent used would
require more time and space than can be given in this
work. I shall confine myself to some of the most important,
and to such articles as are of the greatest interest to
the practitioner.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Soluble Cotton.</span></p>

<p>I have, in my practice and trade, adopted the term
<i>soluble cotton</i> as the one most appropriate, making a desirable
distinction from the article sold as <i>gun cotton</i>, they being
of a somewhat different nature&mdash;gun cotton being the
most explosive and least soluble, while the other preparation
is more soluble and less explosive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[-42-]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two methods employed in the preparation of
soluble cotton; one being by the use of nitric and sulphuric
acids, and the other with sulphuric acid and nitrate of
potash. The last of these I would recommend as being
the most convenient for those who require only a small
quantity of cotton. Persons experimenting in the preparation
of this article should exercise much care and judgment.
A good cotton is not the result of hap-hazard operation.
The operator should be acquainted, as nearly as
possible, with the quality of the chemicals employed, and
the proper mode of manipulation.</p>

<p><i>Articles necessary.</i>&mdash;One quart Wedgewood mortar and
pestle, or evaporating dish; one glass rod; one pane of
glass, large enough to cover the mortar or dish; one ordinary-sized
pail two-thirds full of pure rain or distilled
water, and at least ten times that quantity of water at
hand; twelve ounces (by weight, avoirdupois) of nitrate
of potash (Dupont's refined, pulverized); twelve ounces
(by measure) of commercial sulphuric acid; and three
hundred and forty grains of clean, pure cotton wool.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;It is advisable that the mortar or dish be
deep and narrow, as the mixture can be better formed in
a vessel of this shape. If not convenient to procure a
mortar, a common earthen bowl will answer; glass is objectionable,
as the heat generated in the combination of
the acid and nitre is liable to crack it. A new pail should
not be used, especially if it is painted, as the acids attack
the paint, and injure the cotton. I prefer one that has
been used for some time, and has been frequently cleaned.
A common earthen wash-bowl, or any large glass dish,
will answer in place of the pail. Metal pails or vessels
should not be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[-43-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nitrate of Potash</i> (saltpetre) should be dry and
finely-powdered. I use none other than Dupont's refined; this
is very nearly, if not absolutely, chemically pure.</p>

<p>The commercial <i>Sulphuric Acid</i> (oil of vitriol) of
America is of great uniformity of strength, as sold by druggists
generally. I use a test-bulb graduated to the proper
density, and have been very successful in my experiments.</p>

<p>In some twenty different samples of acid, used in different
cities in the United States, I found only one that produced
a poor cotton, and this might have been influenced
by the moisture of the atmosphere, it being a very rainy
day when I used it.</p>

<p>During my recent and somewhat extensive practice, I
have thought that the <i>fine long fibres</i> of cotton wool do not
make so desirable a soluble cotton as that which is heavy
or common. Four or five very careful experiments upon
this point, have had the effect to produce in me a strong
belief that my ideas are entitled to some consideration.
I should not select the <i>finest</i> cotton for making soluble
cotton, but now invariably take that which is <i>thick</i> or
<i>coarse</i>.</p>

<p>The result of my experience is (other things being
equal), that cotton prepared in fine dry weather has a
greater degree of solubility than when prepared in a moist
atmosphere: hence I would recommend the experimenter
to choose fine, clear weather for preparing it.</p>


<p class="caption3">Manipulation.</p>

<p>Having at hand every article requisite, proceed as follows:&mdash;Put
the nitrate of potash into the mortar or dish;
be sure it is dry and well powdered, and then add the
acid; stir them well with the pestle and glass rod, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[-44-]</a></span>
the lumps will be all (or nearly so) out, and a pasty solution
formed. This operation should not occupy more than
two minutes' time. Then put in the cotton, about one-quarter
of the whole bulk at a time: it should be well
picked apart, so that it may come immediately in contact
with the acids, and should be <i>kneaded</i>, with the pestle and
glass rod, into the solution, and as soon as wetted, another
quarter should be added and wetted as soon as possible;
so continue until all is in: then <i>knead</i> with the pestle and
mortar for at least four minutes, or until every fibre of the
cotton is <i>saturated</i> with the liquid; then the mortar should
be covered over with the pane of glass, and allowed to
stand for fifteen or twenty minutes; then the entire contents
of the mortar should be thrown into the pail two-thirds
full of water, and stirred with the glass rod as rapidly
as possible: if this rapid stirring is omitted, the cotton
will be injured by the action of the acids in combining
with the water. The water should be poured off, and
another change put into the pail.</p>

<p>After about three changes, the hands may be used in the
farther washing. The hands should be perfectly clean,
and free from <i>all chemicals</i>. The changes of water and
washing should be continued until every trace of acid has
disappeared, which can be seen by testing with blue litmus
test-paper. After it is thought that the cotton has
become free, the water may be squeezed out of a little
lump about the size of a pea, and then placed between
the fold of the test-paper, and if it reddens the paper,
there is acid present, and the washing should be continued
until there is no change in the paper. When this is done,
the cotton can be put into the folds of a dry towel or cloth
(which has been thoroughly rinsed, so that no soap be present),
and wrung out as dry as possible, and then it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[-45-]</a></span>
be picked apart and put aside, exposed to a moderate temperature
(say 100° Fahr.) to dry, when it is ready for use.</p>

<p>I employ the method (for convenience, nothing more)
of displacing the water by the use of alcohol. [<i>Cutting's
patent&mdash;<a href="#CORRESPONDENCE">see patents</a>.</i>] I wring out the water as before,
then place the cotton in strong alcohol, stir and press it,
and then pour it off; wring it out again, then put it in a
change of alcohol, let it soak for about five minutes, then
wring it out as dry as possible, pick it apart, and it will dry
immediately, and place it in a close stoppered bottle; or,
if wanted for use at once, put it into the dissolving solution
immediately.</p>

<p>I will here remark that, since the first edition, I have
had occasion to use large quantities of soluble cotton, and
have found that if it be kept in an atmosphere of alcohol
and ether, its solubility is somewhat improved: that
is, in the case of its not being used immediately after its
preparation. This is easily kept, by dropping a few drops
of ether or alcohol into the bottle containing it, and then
sealing close until wanted for use. In the event of the
water being displaced by alcohol, it is not necessary to thoroughly
dry it, but put in a <i>perfectly close</i> bottle to keep.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;There are a few precautions necessary to be
observed in the preparation of soluble cotton. I should
select a fine clear day, if time is no object; nevertheless I
have made a good article in a moderately dense atmosphere.
Sulphuric acid has a powerful affinity for hydrogen,
consequently, in damp weather, it is more or less reduced
by the moisture in the air.</p>

<p>It is advisable to prepare the nitro-sulphuric acid mixture
on a roof, or between two doors or windows, where
there is a good current of air, in order to prevent the
inhalation of white vapors which arise, and are very poisonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[-46-]</a></span>
to the lungs. As a preventive, in case of inhaling
these vapors, I apply the fumes of aqua-ammonia. It
is best for every one to have six or eight ounces of this
always at hand; it neutralizes all acid that maybe spattered
on the clothes, prevents its destructive powers, and
restores the color.</p>

<p>Yellow vapors sometimes appear when putting the cotton
in contact with the solution: this arises from its not
being wet; and when they do appear, the cotton where
they are should be quickly put under the liquid and
kneaded rapidly, which will prevent a continuance of these
vapors. I have had them appear, and used the cotton, and
could not observe that any bad effect had been produced.</p>

<p>The temperature is worthy the attention of the operator:
if it be low, as in winter, and the cotton be left in the
nitro-sulphuric mixture for fifteen or twenty minutes, the
whole becomes a thick, stiff mass, bedded together, and
has not had proper action, giving a bad article. A good
temperature is about 140° Fahr. for the last of the time the
cotton is in the mixture. This is not always convenient; so
the operator will be governed by circumstances, taking
his chance of having a good article. In some cases I have
heated a <i>thick</i> iron plate, at a moderate temperature, placing
the mortar upon it, and thus aided in regulating the
temperature. This is the most convenient method I have
employed.</p>

<p>It has been thought advisable to publish in full the
account of Edw. Ash Hadow's experiments and investigations
upon the subject of soluble cotton. The following
is an account of them as it appeared in <i>Humphrey's Journal</i>,
vol. VI. p. 12:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having, in my earlier experiments on the collodion process
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[-47-]</a></span>
of photography, experienced some difficulty in always
producing a collodion of uniform quality with regard to
sensitiveness, tenacity and fluidity, although making use of
the same materials for its preparation, and this I find being
the complaint of many others, it has been my study lately
to determine the variations in quality to which the ingredients
are liable, and the effects of these variations on the
sensitive film, and likewise to ascertain whether the excellent
qualities of some samples of collodion depend on the
materials in ordinary use, or on some substances accidentally
or intentionally added. Researches in the preparation
of collodion may appear superfluous, now that it is
supplied of the best quality by so many makers; but as
some persons of an independent turn of mind still prefer
manufacturing their own, I venture to bring forward the
subject with the hope of benefiting them. In this beautiful
process so much depends for success on the quality of
the collodion, that when in possession of a good specimen,
it becomes one of the easiest and most simple, and ought
to be the most certain of all the processes yet devised;
for here no material of uncertain composition is introduced,
such as paper, and thus we have nothing to fear
from plaster of Paris, alumina, or specks of iron or copper,
which continually endanger or modify the calotype process;
each ingredient can and ought to be obtained in a
state of perfect purity, and with this precaution the degree
of success depends upon the skill of the operator
himself.</p>

<p>"Of all the substances used in this process, the gun-cotton
is usually the only one actually prepared by the operator
himself; in this he cannot fail to have observed the
great variations in the solubility, and, when dissolved, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[-48-]</a></span>
transparency and tenacity of the films, to which it is liable;
the various processes also that are given appear at first
sight unaccountably different, some directing ten minutes,
others a few seconds immersion. In consequence of this
I have specially examined into the cause of all these variations,
with a view to obtain certainty, and also have endeavored
to discover how far they affect the sensitiveness of the
prepared surface. If we take a mixture of the strongest
nitric and sulphuric acids and immerse as much cotton
as can be wetted, after some minutes squeeze out
the acid as far as possible, then immerse a second portion
of cotton, and again express the acids for a third portion
of cotton, and so on until the liquid is exhausted, we
shall find, on comparing the cottons thus treated, after
washing and drying, that there is a gradual alteration in
their properties, the first being highly and perfectly explosive,
and each succeeding portion less so, until the portion
last immersed will be found hardly explosive, leaving
distinct traces of charcoal or soot when burned. This may
not appear surprising at first sight, as it may be imagined
that the latter portions are only a mixture of gun-cotton
and common cotton; this is, however, not the case, for if
each quantity be immersed sufficiently long, it will not
contain a fibre of common cotton, and may yet become
charred on burning like unaltered cotton. The most remarkable
difference, however, is discovered on treating
them with ether containing a little alcohol, when, contrary
to what might have been anticipated, the first or strongest
gun-cotton remains untouched, while the latter portions dissolve
with the utmost ease, without leaving a trace behind,
which alone is sufficient proof that no unaltered cotton remains.
This difference in properties is owing to the gradual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[-49-]</a></span>
weakening of the acid mixture, in consequence of the
nitric acid being removed by the cotton, with which it becomes
intimately combined, at the same time that the
latter gives out a proportionate quantity of water. In
consequence of these experiments, a great many mixtures
of these acids were prepared of various strengths, each
being accurately known, both to determine whether there
were more than one kind of <i>soluble</i> gun-cotton, and, if
there were, to ascertain exactly the mixture required to
produce the most suitable to photographic purposes. By
this means, and by, what I believe has not been pointed
out, <i>varying the temperature</i>, at least five varieties were
obtained;&mdash;first, gun-cotton, properly so called, as before
stated, quite insoluble in any mixture of alcohol and sulphuric
ether. Secondly, an explosive cotton, likewise insoluble,
but differing chemically from the first, obtained by
a mixture of certain strength when used <i>cold</i>. If <i>warm</i>,
however, either from the heat produced spontaneously on
mixing the two acids; or by raising the temperature artificially
to about 130°, the cotton then immersed becomes
perfectly soluble, producing a third variety; if, however,
it be <i>thoroughly dried</i>, it becomes in a great measure insoluble.
The fourth is obtained by the use of weaker acids
used cold, and the fifth when the mixture has been warmed
to 130° previous to the immersion of the cotton; in either
of the two last cases the product is perfectly soluble, but
there is a remarkable difference between their properties,
for on dissolving 6 grains of each in 1 ounce of ether, the
cotton treated with <i>warm</i> acids gives a perfectly fluid solution
(which is likewise the case with the third variety
produced by acids something stronger), while that obtained
by the use of cold acids makes a mixture as thick as castor-oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[-50-]</a></span></p>

<p>"Having obtained these more strongly marked varieties,
as well as intermediate kinds, with all gradations of solubility,
it was necessary, before I could select any particular
formula for preparing the cotton, to compare their photographic
properties, with especial reference to sensitiveness,
opacity of the reduced silver in negatives, and its
color in positives. A certain weight of each being dissolved
in a portion of the same mixture of alcohol and
ether previously iodized, the comparison was made, by
taking the same objects with each collodion in succession,
and likewise by pouring two samples on the same plate of
glass, and thus exposing them in the camera together, side
by side; this last proved to be much the most satisfactory
plan, and was repeated many times for each sample, taking
care to reverse the order in which they were poured
on, that there might be no mistake arising from the difference
of time elapsing between the pouring on of the collodion
and its immersion in the sensitive bath. By these
experiments I had confidentially hoped to have solved the
question as to the cause of difference in sensitiveness and
other photographic properties of collodion; but in this I
was disappointed, for, after repeated experiments, I believe
I may safely affirm that they are precisely similar as regards
their photographic properties. The same I believe
may be said of Swedish paper collodion, judging from a
few comparative experiments I have made, and indeed it
is difficult to discover what is the superiority of this material
over clean cotton-wool; the ease of manipulation
which some allege is a matter of taste, but I should decidedly
prefer the open texture of cotton to that of a substance
like filtering paper, composed of a mass of compacted
fibres, the innermost of which are only reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[-51-]</a></span>
when the acids have undergone a certain degree of weakening
by the water abstracted from the outer fibres; and
when we consider that from cotton alone we have the
means of preparing all varieties of collodion, from the most
powerfully contracting and transparent to the weakest and
most opaque, and each if required with equal and perfect
certainty, there appears to be choice enough without resorting
to another material, differing only in being more rare
and more difficult to procure. But, although the photographic
properties of these varieties of collodion-wool are
so similar, other circumstances, such as fluidity, tenacity,
and transparency, render its preparation of some importance,
and indicate that the acid mixture should always
be used warm; and it is chiefly in consequence of this very
circumstance, that greater success attends the use of nitrate
of potash and sulphuric acid than that of mixed acids; for
the former when mixed, produce the required temperature,
and <span class="smcap">must</span> be used while warm, since on cooling the mixture
becomes solid, whereas acids when mixed do not
usually produce so high a temperature, and being fluid
can be used at any subsequent period; another obstacle
to their use is the great uncertainty of the strength
of the nitric acid found in the shops, requiring a variation
in the amount of sulphuric acid to be added,
which would have to be determined by calculation or
many troublesome trials. When a proper mixture is obtained,
the <span class="smcap">time</span> of immersion is of no importance, provided
it be not too short, and the temperature be maintained
at about 120° or 130°; ten minutes is generally
sufficient; (though ten hours would not render the cotton
less soluble, as is sometimes asserted.)</p>

<p>"In using the mixed acids, the limits are the nitric acid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[-52-]</a></span>
being too strong, in which case the product is insoluble,
or too weak, when the cotton becomes immediately matted
or even dissolved, if the mixture is warm. I have availed
myself of these facts in order to produce collodion-wool
by the use of acids, without the trouble of calculating
the proper mixture according to their strength. Five
parts by measure of sulphuric acid, and four of nitric acid
of specific gravity not lower than 1·4, are mixed in an
earthenware or thin glass vessel capable of standing heat;
small portions of water are added gradually (by half
drachms at a time, supposing two ounces to have been
mixed,) testing after each addition by immersion of a
small portion of cotton; the addition of water is continued
until a <span class="smcap">fresh</span> piece of cotton is found to contract and dissolve
on immersing; when this takes place, add half the
quantity of sulphuric acid previously used, and (if the
temperature does not exceed 130°, in which case it must
be allowed to cool to that point,) immerse as much cotton,
well pulled out, as can be easily and perfectly soaked; it
is to be left in for ten minutes, taking care that the mixture
does not become cold, and then transferred to cold
water, and thoroughly washed; this is a matter of much
importance, and should be performed at first by changing
the water many times, until it ceases to taste acid, and
then treating it with boiling rain-water until the color of
blue litmus remains unchanged; the freedom from all
trace of acid is insured by adding a little ammonia before
the last washing. Cotton thus prepared should dissolve
perfectly and instantaneously in ether containing a little
alcohol, without leaving a fibre behind, and the film it produces
be of the greatest strength and transparency, being
what M. Gaudin terms 'rich in gun-cotton.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[-53-]</a></span></p>

<p>"The mixture of nitrate of potash and sulphuric acid is
defective chiefly from the want of fluidity, in consequence
of which the cotton is less perfectly acted on; this may
be remedied by increasing the amount of sulphuric acid,
at the same time adding a little water; a mixture of 5
parts of dried nitre, with 10 of sulphuric acid, by weight,
together with 1 of water, produces a much better collodion
wool than the ordinary mixture of 1 of nitre with 1&frac12; of
sulphuric acid. The nitre is <i>dried</i> before weighing, in
order that its amount, as well as that of the water contained
in the mixture, may be definite in quantity; it is
then finely powdered, mixed with the water, and the sulphuric
acid added; the cotton is immersed while the mixture
is hot, and afterwards washed with greater care even
than is required when pure acids are used, on account of
the difficulty of getting rid of all the bisulphate of potash
that adheres to the fibres, which both acts as an acid and
likewise causes the collodion to appear opalescent when
held up to the light; whereas the solution should be perfectly
transparent."</p>

If the coating is opaque, the cotton has not been properly
prepared, the acid mixture has been too weak.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;It is desirable for every operator to use chemicals
of uniform strength, and the better method to adopt
is to employ those purchased from some one respectable
manufactory, and not take those furnished by irresponsible
and unconscientious parties. At least one-half of the
failures experienced by beginners is from want of good
chemicals. It is not economy to purchase a <i>cheap article</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol</i> is an article that can be procured in almost any
small village in the United States, and is in general fit for
collodion purposes. I have used 88 per cent, in the
above proportions, also the intermediate varieties to 98 per
cent., and have been quite successful; but feel convinced
that the ordinary 98, as marked (which usually stands by
actual test 95 to 97 per cent.), is preferable, except in
cases where water is employed in dissolving the iodizing
salts, when I would use fully 98 per cent.</p>

<p>Before concluding the subject on plain collodion, I will
introduce the account given by Mr. E. A. Hadow of his
interesting and valuable experiments, as published in
<i>Humphrey's Journal</i>, Vol. VI, page 18.</p>

<p>"Having obtained good collodion-wool, the next point of
inquiry was with regard to the solvent; to ascertain whether
the addition of alcohol beyond what is necessary to
cause the solution of the gun-cotton in ether, were beneficial
or otherwise. For this purpose ether and alcohol were
prepared perfectly pure, and mixtures were made of 1 of
alcohol to 7 of ether, 2 to 6, 3 to 5, 4 to 4 and 5 to 3. In
one ounce of each were dissolved 6 grains of gun-cotton
and 4 grains of iodide of ammonium (iodide of potassium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[-55-]</a></span>
could not be employed, since it requires a certain amount
both of water and alcohol to keep it in solution); they
were then compared, using a 35-grain solution of nitrate
of silver, both by pouring on separate glasses, and likewise
by covering two halves of a plate with two samples,
as in examining the gun cottons, thus placing them under
the same circumstances during the same time; in this way
the effect of adding alcohol was very clearly perceived,
since the difference between the collodions was much
greater than could have been anticipated.</p>

<p>"The first mixture containing only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th of alcohol was
quite unfit for photographic purposes, from its being almost
impossible, even with the most rapid immersion, to
obtain a film of uniform sensitiveness and opacity throughout,
the surface generally exhibiting nearly transparent
bands, having an iridescent appearance by reflected light.</p>

<p>"The second mixture with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>th of the alcohol is liable to
great uncertainty, for if there be any delay in pouring off
the collodion the same appearances are seen as in the first,
and like it the surface is very insensitive to light, while if
the plate be rapidly plunged in the bath, the collodion
film becomes much more opaque than before, and is then
very sensitive.</p>

<p>"The third proportion of 3 of alcohol to 5 of ether is decidedly
the best, giving without the least difficulty a beautifully
uniform and highly sensitive film, at the same time
perfectly tough and easily removable from the glass if required.
A further addition of alcohol, as in the two last collodions,
was not attended with any corresponding advantage
or increase of sensitiveness; on the contrary, the large
proportion of alcohol rendered them less fluid, though with
a smaller quantity of gun cotton they would produce very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[-56-]</a></span>
good collodions, capable of giving fine films: the cause of
the weakness of the film, observed on adding much of the
ordinary alcohol, is the large amount of water it usually
contains.</p>

<p>"This surprising improvement, caused by the addition of
a certain quantity of alcohol, is referable to causes partly
chemical, partly mechanical, for, on examining the films,
it will be found in the first, and occasionally in the second
collodion, that the iodide of silver is formed on the surface,
and can be removed entirely by friction without destroying
the transparent collodion film below, while in those
collodions that contain more than one-fourth of alcohol,
the iodide of silver is wholly in the substance, and in this
state possesses the utmost sensitiveness.</p>

<p>"This difference of condition is owing to the very sparing
solubility of ether in water, which in the first case prevents
the entrance of the nitrate of silver into the film,
consequently the iodide and silver solutions meet on the
surface; but on addition of alcohol, its solubility enables
the two to interchange places, and thus the iodide of silver
is precipitated throughout the substance in a state of
the utmost division. This difference is clearly seen under
the microscope, the precipitate being clotted in the one
case, while in the other the particles are hardly discoverable
from their fineness.</p>

<p>"The presence of a little water considerably modifies
these results, since it in some degree supplies the place of
alcohol, and is so far useful; but in other respects it is injurious,
for, accumulating in quantity, if the collodion is
often used, it makes the film weak and gelatinous, and
what is worse, full of minute cracks on drying, which is
never the case when pure ether and alcohol are used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[-57-]</a></span>
Since the ether of the shops almost always contains alcohol,
and frequently water, it is important to ascertain their
amount before employing it for the preparation of collodion;
the quantity of alcohol may be easily ascertained
by agitating the ether in a graduated measure glass (a
minim glass does very well) with half its bulk of a <i>saturated</i>
solution of chloride of calcium; this should be poured
in first, its height noted, and the ether then poured on its
surface, the thumb then placed on the top, and the two
agitated together; when separated, the increase of bulk
acquired by the chloride of calcium indicates the quantity
of alcohol present, and for this allowance should be made,
in the addition of alcohol afterwards to the collodion.</p>

<p>"Water is readily detected, either in ether or alcohol by
allowing a drop to fall into spirits of turpentine, with which
they ought to mix without turbidity; this is immediately
produced if they contain water: for detecting water in
<i>alcohol</i>, benzole is a more delicate re-agent than spirits of
turpentine (Chemist, xxix, 203). It is also necessary that
ether should be free from a remarkable property it acquires
by long keeping, of decomposing iodides and setting free
iodine, which thus gives the collodion a brown color; the
same property may be developed in any ether, as Schonbein
discovered by introducing a red hot wire into the vapor
in the upper portion of a bottle containing a little
ether and water; if it be then shaken up and a solution
of iodide poured in, the whole rapidly becomes brown;
this reaction is very remarkable and difficult to explain
for even a mixture of the ether and nitric acid fails to produce
a color <i>immediately</i>. Ether thus affected can only be
deprived of this property by rectification with caustic
potash."</p>

<p>Double iodide of potassium and silver (see <a href="#Page_62">page 62</a>)
enough so that when the plate comes from the nitrate of
silver bath, it will have an opaque cream color.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In the preparation of this sensitive collodion,
it is necessary to be cautious and not add too much of the
iodide of potassium and silver, for in that case the coating
would flake off, and falling into the silvering solution, the
operator would be obliged to filter it before he could silver
his plate with safety as regards spotting it.</p>

<p>The method I employ is to add the plain collodion, bromide
and iodide of potassium and silver, iodide of ammonium
and hydro-bromic acid, and then cautiously add the
double iodide of potassium and silver from five to ten
drops at a time, trying the collodion from time to time
by pouring a little on a narrow strip of glass, which I dip
into the silvering solution, and let it remain for two
minutes. If the coating assumes the proper color (a cream
color), I shake the contents of the bottle, and then stand
it aside to settle: it is better after it has stood for a week
or two.</p>

<p>This collodion I have used after it has been made eight

this nearly altogether in practice. Since the first edition

I have successfully employed, and some operators prefer.</p>

<p>Enough of the double iodide of potassium and silver to
give the coating a cream color when it comes from the
silvering solution. It will take from one to three drachms.
Or this last may be omitted, and a few drops of a saturated
solution of dry iodine in alcohol may be added. Either of
these plans have been successful in my practice.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The iodide of potassium being insoluble in
the collodion, it should be first dissolved in as little water
as possible; <i>i. e.</i>, take the quantity, 30 grains, put it into
a one-ounce graduate, and with a glass rod stir it, adding
water, drop by drop, only until all of the salt is dissolved.
Then it may be poured into the collodion, and there will
be a white powdery precipitate.</p>

<p>The bromide of ammonium will dissolve in the collodion,
and can be put into it. When all of the accelerators are
in, it should be well shaken, and then allowed to settle
and become clear. When wanted, a sufficient quantity
may be poured into a vial (see <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>) for use, and the
main or stock bottle should not be disturbed oftener than
necessary. This last collodion is not as durable as the
first, but is less trouble to prepare.</p>

<p>This collodion should be allowed to stand and settle
twenty-four hours before it is used: when wanted, it
should be poured off into a collodion vial. The more free
the collodion is from sediment and small particles of dust
or undissolved cotton, the softer and more perfect will be
the impression it makes.</p>

<p>In case the above proportions of iodide of potassium
should not produce a cream-colored coating, when it comes
from the nitrate of silver bath, more may be added: for
example, if the coating is of a bluish tint, I would dissolve
6 grains of iodide of potassium in water, as before, and
then try it: shake well, and test it by putting a little on a
slip of glass, and dipping it into the silvering solution; if
it coats to a cream-color, it is right.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind, that after the addition of
iodide of potassium here recommended, the collodion
should be allowed to stand until settled, before undertaking
to produce a picture, although the coating may be
previously tested by means of a slip of glass.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Solution of Bromide and Iodide of Potassium and

<p>Dissolve 130 grains of crystallized nitrate, of silver in 4
ounces of pure water, in a long 8-ounce vial. Then in a
clean 1-ounce graduate, or some other convenient vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[-61-]</a></span>
containing half an ounce of water, dissolve 130 grains
bromide of potassium. When this and the nitrate of silver
are both dissolved, pour the solution of bromide of potassium
into the vial containing the silver, and a thick yellow
precipitate will fall. This is the bromide of potassium
and silver. This should be washed by nearly filling the
vial with water; shake it, and then let it settle, which it
will readily do, and then pour on the water, leaving the
yellow mass in the bottom of the vial; continue this operation
of washing for at least ten changes of water; then,
after draining off the water as close as possible, put into
the vial four ounces of alcohol, shake it well and let it
settle; then pour off as close as possible. By this means
the water is nearly all taken out.</p>

<p>Pour into the vial <i>three</i> ounces of alcohol; then in a small
mortar finely pulverize one ounce of iodide of potassium, and
the solution, which was before clear, will be more or less
of a yellow color, and the bulk of the yellow precipitate
will be diminished. I have sometimes completely re-dissolved
the yellow precipitate, but this does not often occur,
except there be more water present than is advisable. It
is better to have an excess of bromide of potassium in the
solution. This can be seen by its being white, and remaining
undissolved in the bottom of the vial. This solution
should be prepared in the evening, or in a dark room,
and only the light of a lamp or candle employed.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Double Iodide of Potassium and Silver.</span></p>

<p>This solution is made in the same manner as in the

one ounce of pulverized iodide of potassium to effect this,
but it may be added in excess, so that the solution shall

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In my recent tour of the United States, I
found it difficult to obtain a good article of protosulphate
of iron, and in its stead I used the common copperas, such
as I could find almost in any store. I employ from one-fourth
to one-half more than the quantity given above. If
it looked a clear green, and free from a white or brownish
powder, about one-fourth addition: <i>i. e.</i>, four ounces,
instead of three, as given above. If the solution in the
stock bottle is not wanted for a week or more, a few crystals
of the protosulphate of iron should be added, as it
decomposes, and the strength is depreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[-63-]</a></span></p>

<p>There is quite a difference in the strength of the acetic
acid as sold by out country druggists, and the operator
should be sure that he has No. 8, to which quality the
above proportions are adapted. I never have employed
the developing solution but once, but can see no objections
to use it for a number of glass plates, but it should be
filtered every time before using. The quantity of nitric
acid may be increased, so long as a proper proportion is
preserved with the strength of the bath. The effect of
this addition of acid will be to brighten the impression;
but if carried too far, the reduction (developing) will be
irregular, and the harmony of the impression injured.</p>

<p>The article I now employ for finishing off my Positives

It is a new preparation, and exerts a powerful influence
upon the image, having the same brightening effect
as chloride of gold on the daguerreotype. There is no article

is one of the most valuable improvements since the application
of the Collodion Film as a vehicle for producing photographic
images. It is a new discovery, and is being rapidly
brought into use by the first ambrotypers and photographers
in America. It adds at least one-half to the beauty of
an ambrotype, above any method heretofore in use. It is
<i>imperishable</i>, giving a surface almost equal in hardness to the
glass itself. It is easy of application; it gives a brilliant finish;
it is not affected by a moist atmosphere; it is not affected
by pure water; it is the best article ever used for <i>finishing
ambrotypes</i>; it will preserve glass negatives for all
time; it will preserve the <i>whites</i> in the ambrotype; it
gives a rich lustre to drapery; it will bear exposure to the

<div class="sidenote">NITRATE OF SILVER BATH.</div>

<p>I here give what I consider an improvement on the bath
mentioned in the first edition of this work. I first published
it in <i>Humphrey's Journal</i>, No. 23, Vol. VII.:</p>

<p>The nitrate of silver solution is an important mixture in
the chemical department of the ambrotype process, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[-65-]</a></span>
requires the especial care of the operator in its preparation.
I give the following as one of the most approved
for general practice. It is well adapted to the production
of positives, and its action is of great uniformity.</p>

proceed as follows:</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">

  <td class="tdl">Water</td>
  <td class="tdr">40</td>

  <td class="tdr">1800</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Measure the water, and put into a two-quart bottle;
then pour out 8 oz. of it in a pint bottle, and into this put
the whole of the nitrate of silver (1800 gr.); shake it well
until it is all dissolved. This forms a concentrated solution&mdash;into
which put the following prepared iodide of silver:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dissolve in a 3 or 4 oz. bottle containing 1 oz. water,
10 gr. nitrate of silver; and in another bottle or graduate
containing a little water, dissolve 10 grains of iodide of
potassium; pour this into the 10 grain solution of nitrate
of silver, and a yellow substance (iodide of silver) will
precipitate; fill the bottle with water, and let it settle;
then pour off the water, leaving the yellow mass behind;
again pour on it clean water, shake it, and let it settle as
before, and pour off again; repeat this for about six
changes of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[-66-]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it (the iodide of silver) is to be put into the bottle
containing the 8 oz. water and 1800 gr. of nitrate of silver;
shake it well, and it will nearly or quite all dissolve;
pour this into the two-quart bottle, and shake well; it
will be of a yellowish white tint, and should be filtered
through asbestos or sponge, when it will become clear.
When clear, test the solution with blue litmus-paper; if
it turns it red, it is sufficiently acid; if it does not change
it, add <i>one</i> or <i>two</i> drops of nitric acid, chemically pure;
then test it again; if it does not change it, add <i>one</i> or <i>two</i>
drops more, or just enough to change the paper to the
slightest red.</p>

<p>A solution prepared in this proportion will, like others,
improve by age. An old bath is considered far more valuable
than one newly prepared. These remarks may appear
to old photographic operators as of no importance,
but they must bear in mind that there are hundreds just
adopting this new process of picture taking.</p>

<p>This solution will work more satisfactorily than the one
I formerly used. It will work quicker in the camera, and
is <i>equally</i> durable.</p>

<p>Symbol, C{4}H{3}O{3} + HO. Atomic weight, 60.</p>

<p>Acetic acid is a product of the <i>oxidation</i> of alcohol.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[-67-]</a></span>
Spirituous liquids, when perfectly pure, are not affected
by exposure to air; but if a portion of yeast, or nitrogenous
organic matter of any kind, be added, it soon acts as
a <i>ferment</i>, and causes the spirit to unite with oxygen
derived from the atmosphere, and to become <i>sour</i> from formation
of acetic acid or "vinegar."</p>

<p>Acetic acid is also produced on a large scale by heating
<i>wood</i> in close vessels; a substance distils over which is
acetic acid contaminated with empyreumatic and tarry
matter; it is termed pyroligneous acid, and is much used
in commerce.</p>

<p>The most concentrated acetic acid may be obtained by
neutralizing common vinegar with carbonate of soda and
crystallizing out the acetate of soda so formed; this acetate
of soda is then distilled with sulphuric acid, which
removes the soda and liberates acetic acid: the acetic acid
being volatile, distils over, and may be condensed.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Acetic Acid.</i>&mdash;The strongest acid contains
only a single atom of water; it is sold under the name of
"glacial acetic acid," so called from its property of solidifying
at a moderately low temperature. At about 50° the
crystals melt, and form a limpid liquid of pungent odor
and a density nearly corresponding to that of water; the
specific gravity of acetic acid, however, is no test of its
real strength, which can only be estimated by analysis.</p>

<p>The commercial glacial acetic acid is often diluted with
water, which may be suspected if it does not solidify during
the cold winter months. Sulphurous and hydrochloric
acids are also common impurities. They are injurious
in photographic processes from their property of precipitating
nitrate of silver. To detect them proceed as follows:&mdash;dissolve
a small crystal of nitrate of silver in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[-68-]</a></span>
few drops of water, and add to it about half a drachm of
the glacial acid; the mixture should remain quite clear
even when exposed to the light. Hydrochloric and sulphurous
acids produce a white deposit of chloride or sulphite
of silver; and if <i>aldehyde</i> or volatile tarry matter be
present in the acetic acid, the mixture with nitrate of silver,
although clear at first, becomes discolored by the action
of light.</p>

<p>Many photographers employ a cheaper form of acetic
acid, sold by druggists as "Beaufoy's" acid;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> it should be
of the strength of the acetic acid fortiss. of the London
Pharmacop&oelig;ia, containing 30 per cent, real acid, and must
be tested for sulphuric acid (see sulphuric acid), and also
by mixing with nitrate of silver.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Albumen.</span></p>

<p>Albumen is an organic principle, found both in the animal
and vegetable kingdom. Its properties are best studied
in the <i>white of egg</i>, which is a very pure form of
albumen.</p>

<p>Albumen is capable of existing in two states; in one of
which it is soluble, in the other insoluble in water. The
aqueous solution of the soluble variety gives a slightly
alkaline reaction to test-paper; it is somewhat thick and
glutinous, but becomes more fluid on the addition of a
small quantity of an alkali, such as potash or ammonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[-69-]</a></span></p>

<p>Soluble albumen may be converted into the insoluble
form in the following ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>By the application of heat.</i>&mdash;A moderately strong
solution of albumen becomes opalescent and coagulates on
being heated to about 150°, but a temperature of 212° is
required if the liquid is very dilute. A layer of <i>dried</i>
albumen cannot easily be coagulated by the mere application of heat.</p>

<p>2. <i>By addition of strong acids.</i>&mdash;Nitric acid coagulates
albumen perfectly without the aid of heat. Acetic acid,
however, acts differently, appearing to enter into combination
with the albumen, and forming a compound soluble
in warm water acidified by acetic acid.</p>

<p>3. <i>By the action of metallic salts.</i>&mdash;Many of the salts of
the metals coagulate albumen very completely. Nitrate
of silver does so; also the bichloride of mercury. Ammoniacal
oxide of silver, however, does not coagulate albumen.</p>

<p>The white precipitate formed on mixing albumen with
nitrate of silver is a chemical compound of the animal
matter with protoxide of silver. This substance, which
has been termed albuminate of silver, is soluble in ammonia
and hyposulphite of soda; but after exposure to light,
or heating in a current of hydrogen gas, it assumes a brick-red
color, being probably reduced to the condition of a
salt of the <i>suboxide</i> of silver. It is then almost insoluble
in ammonia, but enough dissolves to tinge the liquid wine-red.
The author is of opinion that the <i>red coloration</i> of
solution of nitrate of silver employed in sensitizing the
albumenized photographic paper is produced by the same
compound, although often referred to the presence of sulphuret
of silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[-70-]</a></span></p>

<p>Albumen also combines with lime and baryta; and
chloride of barium has been recommended in positive
printing upon albumenized paper, probably from this
cause.</p>

<p><i>Chemical composition of albumen.</i>&mdash;Albumen belongs to
the <i>nitrogenous</i> class of organic substances. It also contains
small quantities of sulphur and phosphorus.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Alcohol.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, C{4}H{6}O{2}. Atomic weight, 46.</p>

<p>Alcohol is obtained by the careful distillation of any
spirituous or fermented liquor. If wine or beer be placed
in a retort, and heat applied, the alcohol, being more volatile
than water, rises first, and is condensed in an appropriate
receiver; a portion of the vapor of water, however,
passes over with the alcohol, and dilutes it to a
certain extent, forming what is termed "spirits of wine."
Much of this water may be removed by redistillation from
carbonate of potash; but in order to render the alcohol
thoroughly <i>anhydrous</i>, it is necessary to employ <i>quick lime</i>
which possesses a still greater attraction for water. An
equal weight of this powdered lime is mixed with strong
alcohol of ·823, and the two are distilled together.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Alcohol.</i>&mdash;Pure anhydrous alcohol is a limpid
liquid, of an agreeable odor and pungent taste; sp. gr.
at 60°, ·794. It absorbs vapor of water, and becomes
diluted by exposure to damp air; boils at 173° Fahr. It
has never been frozen.</p>

<p>Alcohol distilled from carbonate of potash has a specific
gravity of ·815 to ·823, and contains 90 to 93 per cent,
of real spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[-71-]</a></span></p>

<p>The specific gravity of ordinary rectified spirits of wine
is usually about ·840, and it contains 80 to 83 per cent, of
absolute alcohol.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Ammonia.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, NH{3} or NH{4}O. Atomic weight, 17.</p>

<p>The liquid known by this name is an aqueous solution
of the volatile gas ammonia. Ammoniacal gas contains 1
atom of nitrogen combined with three of hydrogen: these
two elementary bodies exhibit no affinity for each other,
but they can be made to unite under certain circumstances,
and the result is ammonia.</p>

<p>Properties of Ammonia.&mdash;Ammoniacal gas is soluble in
water to a large extent; the solution possessing those properties
which are termed alkaline. Ammonia, however,
differs from the other alkalies in one important particular&mdash;it
is volatile: hence the original color of turmeric paper
affected by ammonia is restored on the application of heat.
Solution of ammonia absorbs carbonic acid rapidly from
the air, and is converted into carbonate of ammonia; it
should therefore be preserved in stoppered bottles. Besides
carbonate, commercial ammonia often contains chloride
of ammonium, recognized by the white precipitate
given by nitrate of silver after acidifying with pure
nitric acid.</p>

<p>The strength of commercial ammonia varies greatly;
that sold for pharmaceutica purposes, under the name of
liquor ammoniæ, contains about 10 per cent, of real ammonia.
The sp. gr. of aqueous ammonia diminishes with
the proportion of ammonia present, the liquor ammoniæ
being usually about ·936.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[-72-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>&mdash;Ammonia, although forming a
large class of salts, appears at first sight to contrast strongly
by composition with the alkalies proper, such as potash
and soda. Mineral bases generally are <i>protoxides of metals</i>,
but ammonia consists simply of nitrogen and hydrogen
united with oxygen. The following remarks may perhaps
tend somewhat to elucidate the difficulty:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Theory of Ammonium.</i>&mdash;This theory supposes that a substance
exists possessing the properties of a metal, but different
from metallic bodies generally in being compound in
structure: the formula assigned to it is NH{4}, 1 atom of
nitrogen united with 4 of hydrogen. The hypothetical
metal is termed "ammonium," and ammonia, associated
with an atom of water, may be viewed as its <i>oxide</i>; for
NH{3} + HO plainly equals NH{4}O. Thus, as potash is the
oxide of <i>potassium</i>, so ammonia is the oxide of <i>ammonium</i>.</p>

<p>The composition of the <i>salts</i> of ammonia is on this view
assimilated to those of the alkalies proper. Thus, sulphate
of ammonia is a sulphate of the oxide of <i>ammonium</i>;
muriate or hydrochlorate of ammonia is a chloride of ammonium, etc.</p>

<p>This elementary substance is obtained from the uncrystallizable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[-73-]</a></span>
residuum of sea-water, termed <i>bittern</i>. It exists
in the water in very minute proportion, combined with
magnesium in the form of a soluble bromide of magnesium.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Bromine is a deep reddish-brown liquid of
a disagreeable odor, and fuming strongly at common
temperatures; sparingly soluble in water (1 part in 23,
Lowig), but more abundantly so in alcohol, and especially
in ether. It is very heavy, having a specific gravity of 3·0.</p>

<p>Bromine is closely analogous to chlorine and iodine in
its chemical properties. It stands on the list intermediately
between the two; its affinities being stronger than
those of iodine, but weaker than chlorine.
 (<i>See</i> <a href="#Chlorine">Chlorine.</a>)</p>

<p>It forms a large class of salts, of which the bromides of
potassium, cadmium, and silver are the most familiar to
photographers.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Bromide of Potassium.</span></p>

<p>Bromide of potassium is prepared by adding bromine to

of bromide of potassium and bromate of potash, to redness,
in order to drive off the oxygen from the latter salt. It
crystallizes in anhydrous cubes, like the chloride, and
iodide, of potassium; it is easily soluble in water, but
more sparingly so in alcohol; it yields red fumes of bromine
when acted upon by sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>This salt was formerly obtained from the ashes of seaweeds,

but is now more economically manufactured on a
large scale from common salt. The chloride of sodium is
first converted into sulphate of soda, and afterwards the
sulphate into carbonate of soda.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;The perfect crystals contain ten atoms of
water, which are driven off by the application of heat,
leaving a white powder&mdash;the anhydrous carbonate. <i>Common
washing soda</i> is a neutral carbonate, contaminated to a
certain extent with chloride of sodium and sulphate of
soda. The carbonate used for effervescing draughts is
either a bicarbonate with 1 atom of water, or a sesquicarbonate,
containing about 40 per cent, of real alkali; it is
therefore nearly double as strong as the washing carbonate,
which contains about 22 per cent, of soda. Carbonate
of soda is soluble in twice its weight of water at 60°,
the solution being strongly alkaline.</p>

<p>Animal charcoal is obtained by heating animal substances,
such as bones, dried blood, horns, etc., to redness,
in close vessels, until all volatile empyreumatic matters
have been driven off, and a residue of carbon remains.
When prepared from bones it contains a large quantity of
inorganic matter in the shape of carbonate and phosphate
of lime, the former of which produces <i>alkalinity</i> in reacting
upon nitrate of silver. Animal charcoal is freed from
these earthy salts by repeated digestion in hydrochloric
acid; but unless very carefully washed it is apt to retain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[-75-]</a></span>
an acid reaction, and so to liberate free nitric acid when
added to solution of nitrate of silver.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Animal charcoal, when pure, consists solely
of carbon, and burns away in the air without leaving any
residue: it is remarkable for its property of decolorizing
solutions; the organic coloring substance being separated,
but not actually <i>destroyed</i>, as it is by <i>chlorine</i> employed as
a bleaching agent. This power of absorbing coloring
matter is not possessed in an equal degree by all varieties
of charcoal, but is in great measure peculiar to those derived
from the animal kingdom.</p>

Hydrochloric acid contains chlorine combined with hydrogen;
by the action of <i>nascent</i> oxygen (see oxygen), the hydrogen
may be removed in the form of water, and the
chlorine left alone.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, of a
pungent and suffocating odor; soluble to a considerable extent
in water, the solution possessing the odor and color of the
gas. It is nearly 2&frac12; times as heavy as a corresponding
bulk of atmospheric air.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>&mdash;Chlorine belongs to a small natural
group of elements which contains also bromine, iodine,
and fluorine. They are characterized by having a strong
affinity for hydrogen, and also for the metals, but are
comparatively indifferent to oxygen. Many metallic substances
actually undergo <i>combustion</i> when projected into an
atmosphere of chlorine, the union between the two taking
place with extreme violence. The characteristic bleaching
properties of chlorine gas are explained in the same
manner:&mdash;Hydrogen is removed from the organic substance,
and in that way the structure is broken up and the
color destroyed.</p>

<p>Chlorine is more powerful in its affinities than either
bromine or iodine. The salts formed by these three elements
are closely analogous in composition and often in
properties. Those of the alkalies, alkaline earths, and
many of the metals are soluble in water, but the silver
salts are insoluble; the lead salts sparingly so.</p>

<p>The combinations of chlorine, bromine, iodine, and
fluorine, with hydrogen, are acids, and neutralize alkalies
in the usual manner, with formation of alkaline chloride
and water.</p>

<p>The test by which the presence of chlorine is detected,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[-77-]</a></span>
either free or in combination with bases, is <i>nitrate of silver</i>;
it gives a white curdy precipitate of chloride of silver, insoluble
in nitric acid, but soluble in ammonia. The solution
of nitrate of silver employed as the test must not
contain iodide of silver, as this compound is precipitated
by dilution.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Chloride of Ammonium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, NH{4}Cl. Atomic weight, 54.</p>

<p>This salt, also known as muriate or hydrochlorate of
ammonia, occurs in commerce in the form of colorless and
translucent masses, which are procured by <i>sublimation</i>, the
dry salt being volatile when strongly heated. It dissolves
in an equal weight of boiling, or in three parts of cold
water. It contains more <i>chlorine</i> in proportion to the
weight used than chloride of sodium, the atomic weights
of the two being as 54 to 60.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Chloride of Barium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, BaCl+2HO. Atomic weight, 123.</p>

<p>Barium is a metallic element, very closely allied to calcium,
the elementary basis of <i>lime</i>. The chloride of barium
is commonly employed as a test for sulphuric acid,
with which it forms an insoluble precipitate of sulphate
of baryta. It is also said to affect the color of the photographic
image when used in preparing positive paper;
which may possibly be due to a chemical combination of
baryta with albumen: but it must be remembered that
this chloride, from its high atomic weight, contains <i>less</i>
chlorine than the alkaline chlorides.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Chloride of Barium.</i>&mdash;Chloride of barium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[-78-]</a></span>
occurs in the form of white crystals, soluble in about two
parts of water, at common temperature. These crystals
contain two atoms of water of crystallization, which are
expelled at 212°, leaving the anhydrous chloride.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Chloride of Sodium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, NaCl. Atomic weight, 60.</p>

<p>Common salt exists abundantly in nature, both in the
form of solid rock-salt and dissolved in the waters of the
ocean.</p>

<p><i>Properties of the pure Salt.</i>&mdash;Fusible without decomposition
at low redness, but sublimes at higher temperatures;
the melted salt concretes into a hard white mass on cooling.
Nearly insoluble in absolute alcohol, but dissolves in
minute quantity in rectified spirit. Soluble in three parts
of water, both hot and cold. Crystallizes in cubes, which
are anhydrous.</p>

<p><i>Impurities of Common Salt.</i>&mdash;Table salt often contains
large quantities of the chlorides of magnesium and calcium,
which, being deliquescent, produce a dampness by
absorption of atmospheric moisture: sulphate of soda is
also commonly present. The salt may be purified by repeated
recrystallization, but it is more simple to prepare
the pure compound <i>directly</i>, by neutralizing hydrochloric
acid with carbonate of soda.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Chloride of Silver.</span>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Citric_Acid"></a>Citric Acid.</span></p>

<p>This acid is found abundantly in lemon-juice and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[-79-]</a></span>
lime-juice. It occurs in commerce in the form of large
crystals, which are soluble in less than their own weight
of water at 60°.</p>

<p>Commercial citric acid is sometimes mixed with tartaric
acid. The adulteration may be discovered by making
a concentrated solution of the acid and adding <i>acetate
of potash</i>; crystals of bitartrate of potash will separate if
tartaric acid be present.</p>

<p>Citric acid is tribasic. It forms with silver a white insoluble
salt, containing 3 atoms of oxide of silver to 1
atom of citric acid. If the citrate of silver be heated in
a current of hydrogen gas, a part of the acid is liberated
and the salt is reduced to a citrate of <i>suboxide</i> of silver;
which is of a red color. The action of white light in reddening
citrate of silver is shown by the author to be of a
similar nature.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Cyanide of Potassium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, K, C{2}N, or KCy. Atomic weight, 66.</p>

<p>This salt is a compound of cyanogen gas with the metal
potassium. Cyanogen is not an elementary body, like
chlorine or iodine, but consists of carbon and nitrogen
united in a peculiar manner. Although a compound substance,
it reacts in the manner of an element, and is therefore
(like <i>ammonium</i>, previously described) an exception
to the usual laws of chemistry. Many other bodies of a
similar character are known.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Ether.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, C{4}H{5}O. Atomic weight, 37.</p>

<p>Ether is obtained by distilling a mixture of sulphuric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[-80-]</a></span>
acid and alcohol. If the formula of alcohol (C{4}H{6}O{2}) be
compared with that of ether, it will be seen to differ from
it in the possession of an additional atom of hydrogen and
of oxygen: in the reaction, the sulphuric acid removes
these elements in the form of water, and by so doing converts
one atom of alcohol into an atom of ether. The
term <i>sulphuric</i> applied to the commercial ether has reference
only to the manner of its formation.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Ether.</i>&mdash;It is neither acid nor alkaline to
test-paper. Specific gravity, at 60°, about ·720. Boils at
98° Fahrenheit. The vapor is exceedingly dense, and
may be seen passing off from the liquid and falling to the
ground: hence the danger of pouring ether from one bottle
to another if a flame be near at hand.</p>

<p>Ether does not mix with water in all proportions; if the
two are shaken together, after a short time the former
rises and floats upon the surface. In this way a mixture
of ether and alcohol may be purified to some extent, as in
the common process of <i>washing</i> ether. The water employed
however always retains a certain portion of ether
(about a tenth part of its bulk), and acquires a strong
ethereal odor; washed ether also contains water in small
quantity.</p>

<p>Bromine and iodine are both soluble in ether, and gradually
react upon and decompose it.</p>

<p>The strong alkalies, such as potash and soda, also decompose
ether slightly after a time, but not immediately.
Exposed to air and light, ether is oxidized and acquires a
peculiar odor.</p>

<p>Ether dissolves fatty and resinous substances readily,
but inorganic salts are mostly insoluble in this fluid.
Hence it is that iodide of potassium and other substances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[-81-]</a></span>
dissolved in alcohol are precipitated to a certain extent by
the addition of ether.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Fluoride of Potassium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, KF. Atomic weight, 59.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>&mdash;Fluoride of potassium is formed by saturating
hydrofluoric acid with potash, and evaporating to
dryness in a platinum vessel. <i>Hydrofluoric acid</i> contains
fluorine combined with hydrogen; it is a powerfully acid
and corrosive liquid, formed by decomposing flour spar,
which is a <i>fluoride of calcium</i>, with strong sulphuric acid;
the action which takes place being precisely analogous to
that involved in the preparation of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;A deliquescent salt, occurring in small and
imperfect crystals. Very soluble in water: the solution
acting upon glass in the same manner as hydrofluoric
acid.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Formic Acid.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, C{2}HO{3}. Atomic weight, 37.</p>

<p>This substance was originally discovered in the <i>red ant</i>
(<i>Formica rufa</i>), but it is prepared on a large scale by
distilling <i>starch</i> with binoxide of manganese and sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;The strength of commercial formic acid is
uncertain, but it is always more or less dilute. The
strongest acid, as obtained by distilling formiate of soda
with sulphuric acid, is a fuming liquid with a pungent
odor, and containing only one atom of water: it inflames
the skin in the same manner as the sting of the ant.</p>

<p>Formic acid reduces the oxides of gold, silver, and mercury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[-82-]</a></span>
to the metallic state, and is itself oxidized into carbonic
acid. The alkaline formiates also possess the same
properties.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Gelatine.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, C{13}H{10}O{5}N{2}. Atomic weight, 156.</p>

<p>This is an organic substance somewhat analogous to
albumen, but differing from it in properties. It is obtained
by subjecting bones, hoofs, horns, calves' feet, etc., to the
action of boiling water. The jelly formed on cooling is
termed size, or when dried or cut into slices, <i>glue</i>. Gelatine,
as it is sold in the shops, is a pure form of glue.
<i>Isinglass</i> is gelatine prepared, chiefly in Russia, from the
air-bladders of certain species of sturgeon.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Gelatine.</i>&mdash;Gelatine softens and swells up
in cold water, but does not <i>dissolve</i> until heated: the hot
solution, on cooling, forms a tremulous jelly. One ounce
f cold water will retain about three grains of isinglass
without gelatinizing; but much depends upon the temperature,
a few degrees greatly affecting the result.</p>

<p>Gelatine forms no compound with oxide of silver analogous
to the albuminate of silver; which fact explains
the difference in the photographic properties of albumen
and gelatine.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Glycerine.</span></p>

<p>Fatty bodies are resolved by treatment with an alkali
into an acid&mdash;which combines with the alkali, forming a
<i>soap</i>,&mdash;and glycerine, remaining in solution.</p>

<p>Pure glycerine, as obtained by Price's patent process of
distillation, is a viscid liquid of sp. gr. about 1·23; miscible
in all proportions with water and alcohol. It is peculiarly
a neutral substance, exhibiting no tendency to combine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[-83-]</a></span>
with acids or bases. It has little or no action upon nitrate
of silver in the dark, and reduces it very slowly even when
exposed to light.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Gold_Chloride_of"></a>Gold, Chloride of.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, AuCl{3}. Atomic weight, 303.</p>

<p>This salt is formed by dissolving pure metallic gold in
nitro-hydrochloric acid, and evaporating at a gentle heat.
The solution affords deliquescent crystals of a deep orange
color.</p>

<p>Chloride of gold, in a state fit for photographic use may
easily be obtained by the following process:&mdash;Place a
half-sovereign in any convenient vessel, and pour on it
half a drachm of nitric acid mixed with two and a
half drachms of hydrochloric acid and three drachms of
water; digest by a gentle heat, but do not <i>boil</i> the acid, or
much of the chlorine will be driven off in the form of gas.
At the expiration of a few hours add fresh aqua-regia in
quantity the same as at first, which will probably complete
the solution, but if not, repeat the process a third
time.</p>

<p>Lastly, neutralize the liquid by adding carbonate of soda
until all effervescence ceases, and a green precipitate
forms; this is <i>carbonate of copper</i>, which must be allowed
several hours to separate thoroughly. The solution then
contains chloride of gold in a neutral state, and free from
copper and silver, with which the metallic gold is alloyed
in the standard coin of the realm.</p>

<p>The weight of a half-sovereign is about 61 grains, of
which 56 grains are pure gold. This is equivalent to 86
grains of chloride of gold, which will therefore be the
quantity contained in the solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[-84-]</a></span></p>

<p>The following process for preparing chloride of gold is
more perfect than the last:&mdash;dissolve the gold coin in
aqua-regia as before; then boil with excess of hydrochloric
acid to destroy the nitric acid, dilute largely with
distilled water, and add a filtered aqueous solution of common
sulphate of iron (6 parts in 1 part of gold); collect
the precipitated gold, which is now free from copper;
re-dissolve in aqua-regia, and evaporate to dryness on a
water bath.</p>

<p>Avoid using ammonia to neutralize chloride of gold, as
it would be liable to occasion a deposit of "fulminating
gold," the properties of which are described immediately
following.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Chloride of Gold.</i>&mdash;As sold in commerce it
usually contains excess of hydrochloric acid, and is then
of a bright yellow color; but when neutral and somewhat
concentrated it is dark red (<i>Leo ruber</i> of the alchemists).
It gives no precipitate with carbonate of soda, unless heat
be applied; the free hydrochloric acid present forms, with
the alkali, chloride of sodium, which unites with the chloride
of gold, and produces a double salt, chloride of gold
and sodium, soluble in water.</p>

<p>Chloride of gold is decomposed with precipitation of
metallic gold by charcoal, sulphurous acid, and many of
the vegetable acids; also by protosulphate and protonitrate
of iron. It tinges the cuticle of an indelible purple
tint. It is soluble in alcohol and in ether.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Gold, Fulminating.</span></p>

<p>This is a yellowish-brown substance, precipitated on
adding ammonia to a strong solution of chloride of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[-85-]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be dried carefully at 212°, but <i>explodes violently</i>
on being heated suddenly about to 290°. Friction also
causes it to explode when dry; but the moist powder may
be rubbed or handled without danger. It is decomposed
by sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p>Fulminating gold is probably an aurate of ammonia,
containing 2 atoms of ammonia to 1 atom of peroxide of
gold.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Gold_Hyposulphite"></a>Gold, Hyposulphite of.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, AuO S{2}O{2}. Atomic Weight, 253.</p>

<p>Hyposulphite of gold is produced by the reaction of
chloride of gold upon hyposulphite of soda.</p>

<p>The salt sold in commerce as sel d'or is a double hyposulphite
of gold and soda, containing one atom of the former
salt to three of the latter, with four atoms of water
of crystallization. It is formed by adding one part of
chloride of gold, in solution, to three parts of hyposulphite
of soda, and precipitating the resulting salt by alcohol;
the chloride of gold must be added to the hyposulphite of
soda, and not the soda salt to the gold.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Hyposulphite of gold is unstable and cannot
exist in an isolated state, quickly passing into sulphur,
sulphuric acid, and metallic gold. When combined with
excess of hyposulphite of soda in the form of sel d'or, it is
more permanent.</p>

<p>Sel d'or occurs crystallized in fine needles, which are
very soluble in water. The commercial article is often
impure, containing little else than hyposulphite of soda,
with a trace of gold. It may be analyzed by adding a
few drops of strong nitric acid (free from chlorine) diluting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[-86-]</a></span>
with water, and afterwards collecting and igniting the yellow
powder, which is metallic gold.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Grape Sugar.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, C{24}H{28}O{28}. Atomic weight, 366.</p>

<p>This modification of sugar, often termed <i>granular sugar</i>,
or <i>glucose</i>, exists abundantly in the juice of grapes, and in
many other varieties of fruit. It forms the saccharine
concretion found in honey, raisins, dried figs, etc. It may
be produced artificially by the action of fermenting principles,
and of dilute mineral acids, upon starch.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Grape sugar crystallizes slowly and with
difficulty from a concentrated aqueous solution, in small
hemispherical nodules, which are hard, and feel gritty
between the teeth. It is much less sweet to the taste
than cane sugar, and not so soluble in Water (1 part dissolves
in 1&frac12; of cold water). Grape sugar tends to absorb
oxygen, and hence it possesses the property of decomposing
the salts of the noble metals, and reducing them by
degrees to the metallic state, even without the aid of lights
The action however in the case of <i>nitrate of silver</i> is slow,
unless the temperature be somewhat elevated. <i>Cane</i>
sugar does not possess these properties to an equal extent,
and hence it is readily distinguished from the other variety.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Honey.</span></p>

<p>This substance contains two distinct kinds of sugar,
grape sugar, and an uncrystallizable substance analogous
to, or identical with, the treacle found associated with common
sugar in the cane juice. The agreeable taste of
honey probably depends upon the latter, but its reducing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[-87-]</a></span>
power on metallic oxides is due to the former. Pure grape
sugar can readily be obtained from inspissated honey, by
treating it with alcohol, which dissolves out the syrup, but
leaves the crystalline portion.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Hydrochloric; Acid.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, HCl. Atomic weight, 37.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid is a volatile gas, Which may be liberated
from the salts termed chlorides by the action of sulphuric
acid. The acid, by its superior affinities, removes
the base; thus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
NaCl + HO SO{3} = NaO SO{3} + HCl.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Abundantly soluble in water, forming the
liquid hydrochloric or muriatic acid of commerce. The
most concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid has a sp.
gr. 1·2, and contains about 40 per cent, of gas; that commonly
sold is somewhat weaker, sp; gr. 1·14 = 28 per cent.
real acid.</p>

<p>Pure hydrochloric acid is colorless, and fumes in the
air. The yellow color of the commercial acid depends
upon the presence of traces of perchloride of iron or
organic matter; commercial muriatic acid also often contains
a portion of free chlorine and of sulphuric acid.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Hydriodic Acid.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, HI. Atomic weight, 127.</p>

<p>This is a gaseous compound of hydrogen and iodine,
corresponding in composition to the hydrochloric acid. It
cannot, however, from its instability, be obtained in the
same manner, since, on distilling an iodide with sulphuric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[-88-]</a></span>
acid, the hydriodic acid first formed is subsequently decomposed
into iodine and hydrogen. An aqueous solution
of hydriodic acid is easily prepared by adding iodine to
water containing sulphuretted hydrogen gas; a decomposition
takes place, and sulphur is set free; thus: HS + I = HI + S.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Hydriodic acid is very soluble in water,
yielding a strongly acid liquid. The solution, colorless
at first, soon becomes brown from decomposition, and liberation
of free iodine. It may be restored to its original
condition by adding solution of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Hydrosulphuric_Acid"></a>Hydrosulphuric Acid.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, HS. Atomic weighty 17.</p>

<p>This substance, also known as sulphuretted hydrogen,
is a gaseous compound of sulphur and hydrogen, analogous
in composition to hydrochloric and hydriodic acids. It is
usually prepared by the action of dilute sulphuric acid
upon sulphuret of iron, the decomposition being similar to
that involved in the preparation of the hydrogen acids
generally:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
FeS + HO SO{3} = FeO SO{3} + HS.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Cold water absorbs three times its bulk of
hydrosulphuric acid, and acquires the peculiar putrid odor
and poisonous qualities of the gas. The solution is faintly
acid to test-paper, and becomes opalescent on keeping,
from gradual separation of sulphur. It is decomposed by
nitric acid, and also by chlorine and iodine. It precipitates
silver from its solutions, in the form of black sulphuret
of silver; also copper, mercury, lead, etc.; but
iron and other metals of that class are not affected, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[-89-]</a></span>
liquid contains free acid. Hydrosulphuric acid is constantly
employed in the chemical laboratory for these and
other purposes.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Hydrosulphate of Ammonia.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, NH{4}S HS. Atomic weight, 51.</p>

<p>The liquid known by this name, and formed by passing
sulphuretted hydrogen gas into ammonia, is a double
sulphuret of hydrogen and ammonium. In the preparation,
the passage of the gas is to be continued until the
solution gives no precipitate with sulphate of magnesia
and smells strongly of hydrosulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Properties,&mdash;Colorless at first, but afterwards changes
to yellow, from liberation and subsequent solution of sulphur.
Becomes milky on the addition of any acid. Precipitates,
in the form of sulphuret, all the metals which
are affected by sulphuretted hydrogen; and, in addition,
those of the class to which iron, zinc, and manganese,
belong.</p>

<p>Hydrosulphate of ammonia is employed in photography
to darken the negative image, and also in the preparation
of iodide of ammonium; the separation of silver from
hyposulphite solutions, etc.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Hyposulphite of Soda.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, NaO S{2}H{2} + 5 HO. Atomic weight, 125.</p>

<p>The hyposulphite of soda commonly employed by photographers
is a neutral combination of hyposulphurous
acid and the alkali soda. It is selected as being more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[-90-]</a></span>
economical in preparation than any other hyposulphite
adapted for fixing.</p>

<p>Hyposulphite of soda occurs in the form of large translucent
groups of crystals, which include five atoms of
water. These crystals are soluble in water almost to any
extent, the solution being attended with the production of
cold; they have a nauseous and bitter taste.</p>

and the mountainous parts of Europe; when boiled
in water, it first swells up, and then yields a substance
which gelatinizes on cooling.</p>

<p>It contains lichen starch; a bitter principle soluble in
alcohol, termed "cetrarine;" and common starch; traces

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iodine.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, I. Atomic weight, 126.</p>

<p>Iodine is chiefly prepared at Glasgow, from <i>kelp</i>, which
is the fused ash obtained by burning seaweeds. The
waters of the ocean contain minute quantities of the
iodides of sodium and magnesium, which are separated
and stored up by the growing tissues of the marine plant.</p>

<p>In the preparation, the mother-liquor of kelp is evaporated
to dryness and distilled with sulphuric acid; the
hydriodic acid first liberated is decomposed by the high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[-91-]</a></span>
temperature, and fumes of iodine condense in the form of
opaque crystals.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Iodine has a bluish-black color and metallic
lustre; it stains the skin yellow, and has a pungent smell,
like diluted chlorine. It is extremely volatile when
moist, boils at 350°, and produces dense violet-colored
fumes, which condense in brilliant plates. Specific gravity
4·946. Iodine is very sparingly soluble in water, 1 part
requiring 7000 parts for perfect solution: even this minute
quantity however tinges the liquid of a brown color. Alcohol
and ether dissolve it more abundantly, forming dark-brown
solutions. Iodine also dissolves freely in solutions
of the alkaline iodides, such as the iodide of potassium, of
sodium, and of ammonium.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>&mdash;Iodine belongs to the chlorine
group of elements, characterized by forming acids with
hydrogen, and combining extensively with the metals (see
chlorine). They are however comparatively indifferent to
oxygen, and also to each other. The iodides of the alkalies
and alkaline earths are soluble in water; also those
of iron, zinc, cadmium, etc. The iodides of lead, silver,
and mercury are nearly or quite insoluble.</p>

<p>Iodine possesses the property of forming a compound of
a deep blue color with starch. In using this as a test, it is
necessary first to liberate the iodine (if in combination),
by means of chlorine, or nitric acid saturated with peroxide
of nitrogen. The presence of alcohol or ether interferes
to a certain extent with the result.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iodide of Ammonium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, NH{4}I. Atomic weight, 144.</p>

<p>This salt may be prepared by adding carbonate of ammonia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[-92-]</a></span>
to iodide of iron, but more easily by the following
process:&mdash;A strong solution of hydrosulphate of ammonia
is first made, by passing sulphuretted hydrogen gas into
liquor ammoniæ To this liquid iodine is added until the
whole of the sulphuret of ammonium has been converted
into iodide. When this point is reached, the solution at
once colors brown from solution of free iodine. On the
first addition of the iodine, an escape of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas and a dense deposit of sulphur take place.
After the decomposition of the hydrosulphate of ammonia
is complete, a portion of hydriodic acid&mdash;formed by the
mutual reaction of sulphuretted hydrogen and iodine&mdash;attacks
any carbonate of ammonia which may be present,
and causes an effervescence. The effervescence being
over, the liquid is still acid to test-paper, from excess of
hydriodic acid; it is to be cautiously neutralized with ammonia,
and evaporated by the heat of a water-bath to the
crystallizing point.</p>

<p>The crystals should be thoroughly dried over a dish of
sulphuric acid, and then sealed in small tubes containing
each about half a drachm of the salt; by this means it
will be preserved colorless.</p>

<p>Iodide of ammonium is very soluble in alcohol, but it
is not advisable to keep it in solution, from the rapidity
with which it decomposes and becomes brown.</p>

<p>The most common impurity of commercial iodide of
ammonium is sulphate of ammonia; it is detected by its
sparing insolubility in alcohol.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iodide of Cadmium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, CdI. Atomic weight, 182.</p>

<p>This salt is formed by heating filings of metallic cadmium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[-93-]</a></span>
with iodine, or by mixing the two together with
addition of water. It is useful in iodizing collodion intended
for keeping, since it does not become brown from
liberation of free iodine with the same rapidity as the
alkaline iodides.</p>

<p>Iodide of cadmium is very soluble both in alcohol and
water; the solution yielding on evaporation large six-sided
tables of a pearly lustre, which are permanent in the air.
The crystalline form of this salt is a sufficient criterion
of its purity.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iodide of Iron.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, FeI. Atomic weight, 154.</p>

<p>Iodide of iron, in a fit state for photographic use, is
easily obtained by dissolving a drachm of iodine in an
ounce of <i>proof spirit</i>&mdash;that is, a mixture of equal bulks
of spirits of wine and water&mdash;and adding an excess of
iron filings. After a few hours, a green solution is obtained
without the aid of heat. The presence of metallic
iron in excess prevents the liberation of iodine and deposit
of peroxide of iron which would otherwise speedily occur.
It is very soluble in water and alcohol, but the solution
rapidly absorbs oxygen and deposits peroxide of iron;
hence the importance of preserving it in contact with metallic
iron, with which the separated iodine may recombine.
By very careful evaporation, hydrated crystals of
protoiodide may be obtained, but the composition of the
solid salt usually sold under that name cannot be depended on.</p>

<p>The <i>periodide</i> of iron, corresponding to the perchloride,
has not been examined, and it is doubtful if any such
compound exists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[-94-]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iodide of Potassium.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, KI. Atomic weight, 166.</p>

<p>This salt is usually formed by dissolving iodine in solution
of potash until it begins to acquire a brown color;
a mixture of iodide of potassium and <i>iodate of potash</i>
(KO IO{5}) is thus formed; but by evaporation and heating
to redness, the latter salt parts with its oxygen, and is
converted into iodide of potassium.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;It forms cubic and prismatic crystals, which
should be hard, and <i>very slightly or not at all deliquescent</i>.
Soluble in less than an equal weight of water at 60°; it
is also soluble in alcohol, but not in ether. The proportion
of iodide of potassium contained in a saturated alcoholic
solution, varies with the strength of the spirit,&mdash;with
common spirits of wine, sp. gr. ·836, it would be
about 8 grains to the drachm; with alcohol rectified from
carbonate of potash, sp. gr. ·823, 4 or 5 grains: with absolute
alcohol, 1 to 2 grains. The solution of iodide of
potassium is instantly colored brown by free chlorine; also
very rapidly by peroxide of nitrogen; ordinary acids, however,
act less quickly, hydriodic acid being first formed,
and subsequently decomposing spontaneously.</p>

<p>Iodide of potassium, as sold in the shops, is often contaminated
with various impurities. The first and most
remarkable is <i>carbonate of potash</i>. When a sample of iodide
of potassium contains much carbonate of potash, it
forms small and imperfect crystals, which are strongly
alkaline to test-paper, and become moist on exposure to
the air, from the deliquescent nature of the alkaline carbonate.
<i>Sulphate of potash</i> is also a common impurity; it
may be detected by chloride of barium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[-95-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chloride of potassium</i> is another impurity; it is detected
as follows:&mdash;Precipitate the salt by an equal weight of
nitrate of silver, and treat the yellow mass with solution
of ammonia; if any chloride of silver is present, it dissolves
in the ammonia, and after nitration is re-precipitated
in white curds by the addition of an excess of pure
nitric acid. If the nitric acid employed is not pure, but
contains traces of free chlorine, the iodide of silver must
be well washed with distilled water before treating it
with ammonia, or the excess of free nitrate of silver dissolving
in the ammonia would, on neutralizing, produce
chloride of silver, and so cause an error.</p>

<p><i>Iodide of potash</i> is a fourth impurity often found in
iodide of potassium: to detect it, add a drop of dilute
sulphuric acid, or a crystal of citric acid, to the solution of
the iodide; when, if much iodate be present, the liquid
will become yellow from liberation of free iodine. The
rationale of this reaction is as follows:&mdash;The sulphuric
acid unites with the base of the salt, and liberates hydriodic
acid (HI), <i>a colorless compound</i>; but if iodic acid
(IO{5}) be also present, it decomposes the hydriodic acid
first formed, oxidizing the hydrogen into water (HO), and
setting free the iodine. The immediate production of a
yellow color on adding a weak acid to aqueous solution of
iodide of potassium is, therefore, a proof of the presence
of an iodate. As iodate of potash is thought to render
collodion insensitive (?), this point should be attended to.</p>

<p>Iodide of potassium may be rendered very pure by recrystallizing
from spirit, or by dissolving in strong alcohol
of sp. gr. ·823, in which sulphate, carbonate, and iodate
of potash are insoluble. The proportion of iodide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[-96-]</a></span>
of potassium contained in saturated alcoholic solutions
varies with the strength of the spirit.</p>

<p>Solution of chloride of barium is commonly used to detect
impurities in iodide of potassium; it forms a white
precipitate if carbonate, iodate, or sulphate be present.
In the two former cases the precipitate dissolves on the
addition of <i>pure</i> dilute nitric acid, but in the latter it is
insoluble. The commercial iodide, however, is rarely so
pure as to remain quite clear on the addition of chloride
of barium, a <i>mere opalescence</i>, therefore, may be disregarded.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iodide of Silver.</span> (<i>See</i> Silver, Iodide of.)</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iron, Protosulphate of.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, FeO SO{3} + 7 HO. Atomic weight, 139.</p>

<p>This salt, often termed <i>copperas</i> or <i>green vitriol</i>, is a most
abundant substance, and used for a variety of purposes in
the arts. Commercial sulphate of iron, however, being
prepared on a large scale, requires recrystallization to render
it sufficiently pure for photographic purposes.</p>

<p>Pure sulphate of iron occurs in the form of large, transparent
prismatic crystals, of a delicate green color: by exposure
to the air they gradually absorb oxygen and become
rusty on the surface. Solution of sulphate of iron, colorless
at first, afterwards changes to a red tint, and deposits
a brown powder; this powder is a <i>basic</i> persulphate of
iron, that is, a persulphate containing an excess of the
oxide or <i>base</i>. By the addition of sulphuric or acetic acid
to the solution, the formation of a <i>deposit</i> is prevented, the
brown powder being soluble in acid liquids.</p>

<p>The crystals of sulphate of iron include a large quantity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[-97-]</a></span>
of water of crystallization, a part of which they lose
by exposure to dry air. By a higher temperature, the salt
may be rendered perfectly <i>anhydrous</i>, in which state it
forms a white powder.</p>

<p>Aqueous solution of sulphate of iron absorbs the <i>binoxide
of nitrogen</i>, acquiring a deep olive-brown color: as
this gaseous binoxide is itself a reducing agent, the liquid
so formed has been proposed as a more energetic developer
than the sulphate of iron alone.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iron, Protonitrate of.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, FeO NO{5} + 7 HO. Atomic weight, 153.</p>

<p>This salt, by careful evaporation <i>in vacuo</i> over sulphuric
acid, forms transparent crystals, of a light green color,
and containing 7 atoms of water, like the protosulphate.
It is exceedingly unstable, and soon becomes red from
decomposition, unless preserved from contact with air.</p>

<p>The following process is commonly followed for preparing
protonitrate of iron:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of nitrate of baryta 300 grains; powder and dissolve
by the aid of heat in three ounces of water; then
throw in, by degrees, with constant stirring, crystallized
sulphate of iron, <i>powdered</i>, 320 grains. Continue to stir
for about five or ten minutes. Allow to cool, and filter
from the white deposit, which is the insoluble sulphate of
baryta.</p>

<p>In place of nitrate of baryta, the nitrate of lead may
be used (sulphate of lead being an insoluble salt), but the
quantity required will be different. The atomic weights
of nitrate of baryta and nitrate of lead are as 131 to 166;
consequently 300 grains of the former are equivalent to
380 grains of the latter.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Iron, Perchloride of.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, Fe{2}Cl{3}. Atomic weight, 164.</p>

<p>There are two chlorides of iron, corresponding in composition
to the protoxide and the sesquioxide respectively.
The protochloride is very soluble in water, forming a
green solution, which precipitates a dirty white protoxide
on the addition of an alkali. The perchloride, on the
other hand, is dark brown, and gives a foxy-red precipitate
with alkalies.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Perchloride of iron may be obtained in the
solid form by heating iron wire in excess of chlorine; it
condenses in the shape of brilliant and iridescent brown
crystals, which are volatile, and dissolve in water, the solution
being acid to test-paper. It is also soluble in alcohol,
forming the <i>tinctura ferri sesquichloridi</i> of the Pharmacop&oelig;ia.
Commercial perchloride of iron ordinarily contains
an excess of hydrochloric acid.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Litmus.</span></p>

<p>Litmus is a vegetable substance, prepared from various

plaster of Paris, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Litmus occurs in commerce in the form of small cubes,
of a fine violet color. In using it for the preparation of
test-papers, it is digested in hot water, and sheets of porous
paper are soaked in the blue liquid so formed. The
red papers are prepared at first in the same manner, but
afterwards placed in water which has been rendered
faintly acid with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>Symbol, HgCl{2}. Atomic weight, 274.</p>

<p>This salt, also called corrosive sublimate, and sometimes
<i>chloride of mercury</i> (the atomic weight of mercury being
halved), may be formed by heating mercury in excess of
chlorine, or, more economically, by subliming a mixture of
persulphate of mercury and chloride of sodium.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;a very corrosive and poisonous salt, usually
sold in semi-transparent, crystalline masses, or in the
state of powder. Soluble in 16 parts of cold, and in 3 of
hot water; more abundantly so in alcohol, and also in
ether. The solubility in water may be increased almost
to any extent by the addition of free hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>The protochloride of mercury is an insoluble white
powder, commonly known under the name of <i>calomel</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Milk"></a>Milk.</span></p>

<p>The milk of herbivorous animals contains three principal
constituents&mdash;fatty matter, caseine, and sugar; in addition
to these, small quantities of the chloride of potassium,
and of phosphates of lime and magnesia, are
present.</p>

<p>The fatty matter is contained in small cells, and forms
the greater part of the cream which rises to the surface of
the milk on standing. Hence <i>skimmed</i> milk is to be preferred
for photographic use.</p>

<p>The second constituent, <i>caseine</i>, is an organic principle
somewhat analogous to albumen in composition and properties.
Its aqueous solution however does not, like
albumen, <i>coagulate</i> on boiling, unless <i>an acid</i> be present,
which probably removes a small portion of alkali with
which the caseine was previously combined. The substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[-100-]</a></span>
termed "rennet," which is the dried stomach of the
calf, possesses the property of coagulating caseine, but the
exact mode of its action is unknown. Sherry wine is also
employed to curdle milk; but brandy and other spirituous
liquids, when free from acid and astringent matter, have
no effect.</p>

<p>In all these cases a proportion of the caseine usually remains
in a soluble form in the <i>whey</i>; but when the milk
is coagulated by the addition of acids, the quantity so left
is very small, and hence the use of the rennet is to be preferred,
since the presence of caseine facilitates the reduction
of the sensitive silver salts.</p>

<p>Caseine combines with oxide of silver in the same manner
as albumen, forming a white coagulum, which becomes
<i>brick-red</i> on exposure to light.</p>

<p>Sugar of milk, the third principal constituent, differs
from both cane and grape sugar; it may be obtained by
evaporating <i>whey</i> until crystallization begins to take place.
It is hard and gritty, and only slightly sweet; slowly
soluble, without forming a syrup, in about two and a half
parts of boiling, and six of cold water. It does not ferment
and form alcohol on the addition of yeast, like grape
sugar, but by the action of <i>decomposing animal matter</i> is
converted into lactic acid.</p>

<p>When skimmed milk is exposed to the air for some
hours it gradually becomes <i>sour</i>, from lactic acid formed in
this way; and if then heated to ebullition, the caseine
coagulates very perfectly.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Nitric Acid.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, NO{5}. Atomic weight, 54.</p>

<p>Nitric acid, or <i>aqua-fortis</i>, is prepared by adding sulphuric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[-101-]</a></span>
acid to nitrate of potash, and distilling the mixture
in a retort. Sulphate of potash and free nitric acid are
formed, the latter of which, being volatile, distils over in
combination with one atom of water previously united
with sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Anhydrous nitric acid is a solid substance,
white and crystalline, but it cannot be prepared except by
an expensive and complicated process.</p>

<p>The concentrated liquid nitric acid contains 1 atom of
water, and has a sp. gr. of about 1·5: if perfectly pure it
is colorless, but usually it has a slight yellow tint, from
partial decomposition into peroxide of nitrogen: it fumes
strongly in the air.</p>

<p>The strength of commercial nitric acid is subject to
much variation. An acid of sp. gr. 1·42, containing about
4 atoms of water, is commonly met with. If the specific
gravity is much lower than this (less than 1·36), it will
scarcely be adapted for the preparation of peroxyline.
The yellow <i>nitrous acid</i>, so called, is a strong nitric acid
partially saturated with the brown vapors of peroxide of
nitrogen; it has a high specific gravity, but this is somewhat
deceptive, being caused in part by the presence of the
peroxide. On mixing with sulphuric acid the color disappears,
a compound being formed which has been termed
a <i>sulphate of nitrous acid</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chemical properties.</i>&mdash;Nitric acid is a powerful oxidizing
agent; it dissolves all the common metals, with the exception
of gold and platinum. Animal substances, such
as the cuticle, nails, etc., are tinged of a permanent yellow
color, and deeply corroded by a prolonged application.
Nitric acid forms a numerous class of salts, all of which
<i>are soluble in water</i>. Hence its presence cannot be determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[-102-]</a></span>
by any precipitating re-agent, in the same manner
as that of hydrochloric and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><i>Impurities of Commercial Nitric Acid.</i>&mdash;These are principally
<i>chlorine</i> and <i>sulphuric acid</i>; also peroxide of nitrogen,
which tinges the acid yellow, as already described.
Chlorine is detected by diluting the acid with an equal
bulk of distilled water, and adding a few drops of nitrate
of silver,&mdash;a <i>milkiness</i>, which is chloride of silver in suspension,
indicates the presence of chlorine. In testing
for sulphuric acid, dilute the nitric acid as before, and
drop in <i>a single drop</i> of solution of chloride of barium; if
sulphuric acid be present, an insoluble precipitate of sulphate
of baryta will be formed.</p>

natural product, found effloresced upon the soil in certain
parts of the East Indies. It is also produced artificially in
what are called nitre-beds.</p>

<p>Nitrate of potash is <i>an anhydrous salt</i>,&mdash;it contains
simply nitric acid and potash, without any water of crystallization;
still, in many cases, a little water is retained
mechanically between the interstices of the crystals, and
therefore it is better to dry before use. This may be
done by laying it in a state of fine powder upon blotting-paper,
close to a fire, or upon a heated metallic plate.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Nitrate of Lead.</span></p>

decrepitate on being heated; they are soluble in 8 parts
of water at 60°.</p>

<p>This liquid is the aqua-regia of the old alchemists. It
is produced by mixing nitric and hydrochloric acids: the
oxygen contained in the former combines with the hydrogen
of the latter, forming water and liberating chlorine,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">

</p>

<p>The presence of free chlorine confers on the mixture the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[-104-]</a></span>
power of dissolving gold and platinum, which neither of
the two acids possesses separately. In preparing aqua-regia
it is usual to mix one part, by measure, of nitric
acid with four of hydrochloric acid, and to dilute with an
equal bulk of water. The application of a gentle heat
assists the solution of the metal; but if the temperature
rises to the boiling point, a violent effervescence and escape
of chlorine takes place.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Oxygen.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, O. Atomic weight, 8.</p>

<p>Oxygen gas may be obtained by heating nitrate of potash
to redness, but in this case it is contaminated with a
portion of nitrogen. The salt termed chlorate of potash
(the composition of which is closely analogous to that of
the nitrate, chlorine being substituted for nitrogen) yields
abundance of pure oxygen gas on the application of heat,
leaving behind chloride of potassium.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>&mdash;Oxygen combines eagerly with
many of the chemical elements, forming oxides. This
chemical affinity however is not well seen when the elementary
body is exposed to the action of <i>oxygen in the
gaseous form</i>. It is the <i>nascent</i> oxygen which acts most
powerfully as an oxidizer. By nascent oxygen is meant
oxygen on the point of separation from other elementary
atoms with which it was previously associated; it may
then be considered to be in the liquid form, and hence it
comes more perfectly into contact with the particles of the
body to be oxidized.</p>

<p>Illustrations of the superior chemical energy of nascent
oxygen are numerous, but none perhaps are more striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[-105-]</a></span>
than the mild and gradual oxidizing influence exerted by
atmospheric air, as compared with the violent action of

<p>Potash is obtained by separating the carbonic acid
from carbonate of potash by means of caustic lime. Lime
is a more feeble base than potash, but the carbonate of
lime, being <i>insoluble</i> in water, is at once formed on adding
milk of lime to a solution of carbonate of potash.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Usually met with in the form of solid
lumps, or in cylindrical sticks, which are formed by melting
the potash and running it into a mould. It always
contain some atoms of water, which cannot be driven off by
the application of heat.</p>

<p>Potash is soluble almost to any extent in water, much
heat being evolved. The solution is powerfully alkaline
and acts rapidly upon the skin; it dissolves fatty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[-106-]</a></span>
resinous bodies, converting them into soaps; Solution of
potash absorbs carbonic acid quickly from the air, and

the same manner as carbonate of soda is prepared from
the ashes of seaweeds. Salts of potash and of soda appear
essential to vegetation, and are absorbed and approximated
by the living tissues of the plant. They exist in
the vegetable structure combined with organic acids in the
form of salts, like the oxalate, tartrate, etc., which when
burned are converted into carbonates.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;The pearlash of commerce contains large
and variable quantities of chloride of potassium, sulphate
of potash, etc. A purer carbonate is sold, which is free
from sulphates, and with only a trace of chlorides. Carbonate
of potash is a strongly alkaline salt, deliquescent,
and soluble in twice its weight of cold water; insoluble in
alcohol, and employed to deprive it of water.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Pyrogallic Acid.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, C{8}H{4}O{4} (Stenhouse). Atomic weight. 84.</p>

<p>The term <i>pyro</i> prefixed to gallic acid implies that the
new substance is obtained by the <i>action of heat</i> upon that
body. At a temperature of about 410° Fahr., gallic acid
is decomposed, and a white sublimate forms, which condenses
in lamellar Crystals; this is pyrogallic acid.</p>

<p>Pyrogallic acid is very soluble in cold water, and in alcohol
and ether; the solution decomposes and becomes
brown by exposure to the air. It gives an indigo blue
color with protosulphate of iron, which changes to dark
green if any persulphate be present.</p>

<p>Although termed an <i>acid</i>, this substance is strictly <i>neutral</i>;
it does not redden litmus-paper, and forms no salts.
The addition of potash or soda decomposes pyrogallic acid,
at the same time increasing the attraction for oxygen;
hence this mixture may conveniently be employed for
absorbing the oxygen contained in atmospheric air. The
compounds of silver and gold are reduced by pyrogallic
acid even more rapidly than by gallic acid, the reducing
agent absorbing the oxygen, and becoming converted
into carbonic acid and a brown matter insoluble in water.</p>

<p>Commercial pyrogallic acid is often contaminated with
empyreumatic oil, and also with a black insoluble substance
known as <i>metagallic acid</i>, which is formed when
the heat is raised above the proper temperature in the process
of manufacture.</p>

<p>This metal, the <i>luna</i> or <i>diana</i> of the alchemists, is found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[-108-]</a></span>
native in Peru and Mexico; it occurs also in the form of
sulphuret of silver.</p>

<p>When pure it has a sp. gr. of 10·5, and is very malleable
and ductile; melts at a bright red heat. Silver does not
oxidize in the air, but when exposed to an impure atmosphere
containing traces of sulphuretted hydrogen, it is
slowly tarnished from formation of sulphuret of silver. It
dissolves in sulphuric acid, but the best solvent is nitric
acid.</p>

<p>The standard coin of the realm is an alloy of silver and
copper, containing about one-eleventh of the latter metal.
It may be converted into nitrate of silver, sufficiently pure
for photographic purposes, by dissolving it in nitric acid
and evaporating the solution to the crystallizing point: or,
if the quantity be small, the solution may be boiled
down to complete dryness, and the residue <i>fused</i> strongly;
which decomposes the nitrate of copper, but leaves the
greater portion of the silver salt unaffected. (N. B.
Nitrate of silver which has undergone fusion contains
nitrite of silver, and will require the addition of acetic
acid if used for preparing the collodion sensitive film.)</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Silver_Ammonio-Nitrate"></a>Silver, Ammonio-Nitrate of.</span></p>

<p>Crystallized nitrate of silver absorbs ammoniacal gas
rapidly, with production of heat sufficient to fuse the resulting
compound, which is white, and consists of 100
parts of the nitrate + 29·5 of ammonia. The compound
however which photographers employ under the name of
ammonio-nitrate of silver, may be viewed more simply as
a solution of the oxide of silver in ammonia, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[-109-]</a></span>
reference to the nitrate of ammonia necessarily produced in
the reaction.</p>

<p>Very strong ammonia, in acting upon oxide of silver,
converts it into a black powder, termed <i>fulminating silver</i>,
which possesses the most dangerous explosive properties.
Its composition is uncertain. In preparing ammonio-nitrate
of silver by the common process, the oxide first precipitated
occasionally leaves a little black powder behind,
on re-solution; this does not appear, however, according
to the observations of the author, to be fulminating silver.</p>

<p>In sensitizing salted paper by the ammonio-nitrate of
silver, <i>free ammonia</i> is necessarily formed. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
Chloride of ammonium + oxide of silver in ammonia
 = chloride of silver + ammonia + water.

<p>If a little potash or ammonia be added to solution of
nitrate of silver, a brown substance is formed, which, on
standing, collects at the bottom of the vessel. This is
oxide of silver, displaced from its previous state of combination
with nitric acid by the stronger oxide, potash.
Oxide of silver is soluble <i>to a very minute extent</i> in pure
water, the solution possessing an alkaline reaction to litmus;
it is easily dissolved by nitric or acetic acid, forming
a neutral nitrate or acetate; also soluble in ammonia
(ammonio-nitrate of silver), and in nitrate of ammonia
hyposulphite of soda, and cyanide of potassium. Long
exposure to light converts it into a black substance, which
is probably a suboxide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[-110-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Properties of the Suboxide of Silver.</i>&mdash;Suboxide of
silver bears the same relation to the ordinary brown protoxide
of silver that subchloride bears to protochloride of
silver.</p>

<p>It is a black powder, which assumes the metallic lustre
on rubbing, and when treated with dilute acids is resolved
into protoxide of silver which dissolves, and metallic
silver.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of Chloride of Silver by double decomposition.</i>&mdash;In
order to illustrate this, take a solution in water
of chloride of sodium or "common salt," and mix it with
a solution containing nitrate of silver; immediately a
dense, curdy, white precipitate falls, which is the substance
in question.</p>

<p>In this reaction the elements change places; the chlorine
leaves the sodium with which it was previously combined,
and crosses over to the silver; the oxygen and nitric
acid are released from the silver, and unite with the
sodium: thus</p>

<p class="tdc">
Chloride of sodium + nitrate of silver = Chloride of silver + nitrate of soda.<br />
</p>

<p>This interchange of elements is termed by chemists
<i>double decomposition</i>.</p>

<p>The essential requirements in two salts intended for the
preparation of chloride of silver, are simply that the first
should contain chlorine, the second silver, and that both
should be soluble in water; hence the chloride of potassium
or ammonium may be substituted for the chloride of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[-111-]</a></span>
sodium, and the sulphate or acetate for the nitrate of
silver.</p>

<p>In preparing chloride of silver by double decomposition,
the white clotty masses which first form must be washed
repeatedly with water, in order to free them from soluble
nitrate of soda, the other product of the change. When
this is done, the salt is in a pure state, and may be dried,
etc., in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Chloride of Silver.</i>&mdash;Chloride of silver
differs in appearance from the nitrate of silver. It is not
met with in crystals, but forms a soft white powder resembling
common chalk or whiting. It is tasteless and insoluble
in water; unaffected by boiling with the strongest
nitric acid, but sparingly dissolved by concentrated hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p>Ammonia dissolves chloride of silver freely, as do solutions
of hyposulphite of soda and cyanide of potassium.
Concentrated solutions of alkaline chlorides, iodides, and
bromides are likewise solvents of chloride of silver, but
to a limited extent.</p>

<p>Dry chloride of silver heated to redness fuses, and concretes
on cooling into a tough and semi-transparent substance,
which has been termed <i>horn silver</i> or <i>luna cornea</i>.</p>

<p>Placed in contact with metallic zinc or iron acidified
with dilute sulphuric acid, chloride of silver is reduced to
the metallic state, the chlorine passing to the other metal
under the decomposing influence of the galvanic current
which is established.</p>

<p><i>Preparation and properties of the Subchloride of Silver.</i>&mdash;If
a plate of polished silver be dipped in solution of perchloride
of iron, or of bichloride of mercury, a <i>black stain</i>
is produced, the iron or mercury salt losing a portion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[-112-]</a></span>
chlorine, which passes to the silver and converts it superficially
into subchloride of silver. This compound differs
from the white chloride of silver in containing less chlorine
and more of the metallic element; the composition
of the latter being represented by the formula AgCl, that
of the former may perhaps be written as Ag{2}Cl. (?)</p>

<p>Subchloride of silver is interesting to the photographer
as corresponding in properties and composition with the
ordinary chloride of silver blackened by light. It is a
pulverulent substance of a bluish-black color, which is
decomposed by ammonia, hyposulphite of soda, and cyanide
of potassium, into chloride of silver which dissolves,
and insoluble metallic silver.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Silver_Bromide"></a>Silver, Bromide of.</span></p>

<p>This substance so closely resembles the corresponding
salts containing, chlorine and iodine, that a short notice of
it will suffice.</p>

<p>Bromide of silver is prepared by exposing a silvered
plate to the vapor of bromine, or by adding solution of
bromide of potassium to nitrate of silver. It is an insoluble
substance, slightly yellow in color, and distinguished
from iodide of silver by dissolving in strong ammonia and
in chloride of ammonium. It is freely soluble in hyposulphite
of soda and in cyanide of potassium.</p>

<p><i>Preparation and Properties of Iodide of Silver.</i>&mdash;Iodide
of silver may be formed in an analogous manner to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[-113-]</a></span>
chloride, viz. by the direct action of the vapor of iodine
upon metallic silver, or by double decomposition between
solutions of iodide of potassium and nitrate of silver.</p>

<p>When prepared by the latter mode it forms an impalpable
powder, the color of which varies slightly with the
manner of precipitation. If the iodide of potassium be
in excess, the iodide of silver falls to the bottom of the
vessel nearly white; but with an excess of nitrate of silver
it is of a straw-yellow tint. This point may be noticed,
because the yellow salt is the one adapted for photographic
use, the other being insensible to the influence
of light.</p>

<p>Iodide of silver is tasteless and inodorous; insoluble in
water and in dilute nitric acid. It is scarcely dissolved by
ammonia, which serves to distinguish it from the chloride
of silver, freely soluble in that liquid. Hyposulphite of
soda and cyanide of potassium both dissolve iodide of silver;
it is also soluble in solutions of the alkaline bromides
and iodides.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[-114-]</a></span>
of ammonia, upon the silver salts; the decomposition
of hyposulphite of silver also furnishes the black
sulphuret.</p>

<p>Sulphuret of silver is insoluble in water, and nearly so
in those substances which dissolve the chloride, bromide,
and iodide, such as ammonia, hyposulphites, cyanides,
etc.; but it dissolves in nitric acid, being converted into
soluble sulphate and nitrate of silver.</p>

<p>Symbol, AgO NO{5}. Atomic weight, 170.</p>

<p>Nitrate of silver is prepared by dissolving metallic silver
in nitric acid. Nitric acid is a powerfully acid and
corrosive substance, containing two elementary bodies
united in definite proportions. These are nitrogen and
oxygen; the latter being present in greatest quantity.</p>

<p>Nitric acid is a powerful solvent for the metallic bodies
generally. To illustrate its action in that particular, as
contrasted with other acids, place pieces of silver foil in
two test-tubes, the one containing dilute sulphuric, the
other dilute nitric acid; on the application of heat a violent
action soon commences in the latter, but the former
is unaffected. In order to understand the cause of the
difference, it must be borne in mind that when a metallic
substance dissolves in an acid, the nature of the solution
is unlike that of an <i>aqueous</i> solution of salt or sugar. If
you take salt water, and boil it down until the whole of
the water has evaporated, you obtain the salt again, with
properties the same as at first; but if a similar experiment
be made with a solution of silver in nitric acid, the
result is different: in that case you do not get metallic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[-115-]</a></span>
silver on evaporation, but silver <i>combined with oxygen</i> and
<i>nitric acid</i>, both of which are tightly retained, being, in
fact, in a state of chemical combination with the metal.</p>

<p>If we closely examine the effects produced by treating
silver with nitric acid, we find them to be of the following
nature:&mdash;first, a certain amount of oxygen is imparted to
the metal, so as to form an <i>oxide</i>, and afterwards this oxide
dissolves in another portion of the nitric acid, producing
<i>nitrate</i> of the oxide, or, as it is shortly termed, nitrate of
silver.</p>

<p>It is therefore the <i>instability</i> of nitric acid, its proneness
to part with oxygen, which renders it superior to sulphuric
acid in the experiment of dissolving silver. Nitric
acid stands high in the list of "oxidizing agents," and it
is important that the photographer should bear this fact
in mind.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;In the preparation of
nitrate of silver, when the metal has dissolved, the solution
is boiled down in order to drive off the excess of nitric
acid, and set aside to crystallize. The salt, however,
as so obtained is still acid to test-paper, and requires either
recrystallization, or a careful heating to about 300° Fahrenheit,
to render it perfectly neutral.</p>

<p>Pure nitrate of silver occurs in the form of white crystalline
plates, which are very heavy and dissolve readily
in an equal weight of cold water. The solubility is much
lessened by the presence of free nitric acid, and in the
<i>concentrated</i> nitric acid the crystals are almost insoluble.
Boiling alcohol takes up about one-fourth part of its
weight of the crystallized nitrate, but deposits nearly the
whole on cooling. Nitrate of silver has an intensely bitter
and nauseous taste; acting as a caustic, and corroding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[-116-]</a></span>
skin by a prolonged application. Its aqueous solution is
perfectly neutral to test-paper.</p>

<p>Heated in a crucible the salt melts, and when poured
into a mould and solidified, forms the <i>lunar caustic</i> of commerce.
At a still higher temperature it is decomposed,
and bubbles of oxygen gas are evolved. The melted mass,
cooled and dissolved in water, leaves behind a black powder,
and yields a solution which is faintly alkaline to test-paper.
The alkalinity depends upon the presence of <i>nitrite</i>
of silver associated with excess of oxide, in the form
probably of a basic or <i>sub</i>-nitrite of silver.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Nitrite of silver differs from the nitrate in containing less oxygen, and
is formed from it by the abstraction of two atoms of that element.</p></div>

<p>Solution of nitrate of silver is decomposed by iron,
zinc, copper, mercury, etc., the nitric acid and oxygen
passing to the other metal, and metallic silver being precipitated.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Silver, Nitrite of.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, AgO NO{3}. Atomic weight, 154.</p>

<p>Nitrite of silver is a compound of nitrous acid, or NO{3},
with oxide of silver. It is formed by heating nitrate of
silver, so as to drive off a portion of its oxygen, or more
conveniently, by mixing nitrate of silver and nitrate of
potash in equal parts, fusing strongly, and dissolving in a
small quantity of boiling water; on cooling, the nitrite
crystallizes out, and may be purified by pressing in blotting
paper. Mr. Hadow describes an economical method
of preparing nitrite of silver in quantity, viz. by heating
1 part of starch in 8 of nitric acid of 1·25 specific gravity,
and conducting the evolved gases into a solution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[-117-]</a></span>
pure carbonate of soda until effervescence has ceased.
The nitrite of soda thus formed is afterwards added to
nitrate of silver in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Nitrite of silver is soluble in 120 parts of
cold water; easily soluble in boiling water, and crystallizes,
on cooling, in long slender needles. It has a certain
degree of affinity for oxygen, and tends to pass into the
condition of nitrate of silver; but it is probable that its
photographic properties depend more upon a decomposition
of the salt and liberation of nitrous acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Nitrous Acid.</i>&mdash;This substance possesses
very feeble acid properties, its salts being decomposed even
by acetic acid. It is an unstable body, and splits up, in
contact with water, into binoxide of nitrogen and nitric
acid. The peroxide of nitrogen, NO{4}, is also decomposed
by water and yields the same products.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap"><a id="Silver_Acetate"></a>Silver, Acetate of.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, AgO (C{4}H{3}O{3}). Atomic weight, 167.</p>

<p>This is a difficultly soluble salt, deposited in lamellar
crystals when an acetate is added to a strong solution of nitrate
of silver. If <i>acetic acid</i> be used in place of an
acetate, the acetate of silver does not fall so readily, since
the nitric acid which would then be liberated impedes the
decomposition.</p>

<p>In order to understand, more fully how <i>decomposition</i> of
hyposulphite of silver may affect the process of fixing, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[-118-]</a></span>
peculiar properties of this salt should be studied. With
this view nitrate of silver and hyposulphite of soda may
be mixed in equivalent proportions, viz. about twenty-one
grains of the former salt to sixteen grains of the latter,
first dissolving each in separate vessels in half an ounce
of distilled water. These solutions are to be added to
each other and well agitated; immediately a dense deposit
forms, which is hyposulphite of silver.</p>

<p>At this point a curious series of changes commences.
The precipitate, at first white and curdy, soon alters in
color: it becomes canary-yellow, then of a rich orange-yellow,
afterwards liver-color, and finally black. The
<i>rationale</i> of these changes is explained to a certain extent
by studying the composition of the hyposulphite of silver.</p>

<p>The formula for this substance is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
AgO S{2}O{2},<br />
</p>

<p>But AgO S{2}O{2} plainly equals AgS, or sulphuret of silver,
and SO{3}, or sulphuric acid. The acid reaction assumed
by the supernatant liquid is due therefore to sulphuric
acid, and the black substance formed is sulphuret of silver.
The yellow and orange-yellow compounds are earlier
stages of the decomposition, but their exact nature is uncertain.</p>

<p>The instability of hyposulphite of silver is principally
seen when, it is in an isolated state: the presence of an
excess of hyposulphite of soda renders it more permanent,
by forming a double salt.</p>

<p>In fixing photographic prints this brown deposit of sulphuret
of silver is very liable to form in the bath and upon
the picture; particularly so when the <i>temperature</i> is high.
To obviate it observe the following directions:&mdash;It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[-119-]</a></span>
especially in the reaction between <i>nitrate of silver</i> and hyposulphite
of soda that the blackening is seen; the chloride
and other <i>insoluble</i> salts of silver being dissolved, even to
saturation, without any decomposition of the hyposulphite
first formed. Hence, if the print be washed in water to
remove the soluble nitrate, a very much weaker fixing
bath than usual may be employed. This plan, however,
involving a little additional trouble, is, on that account,
often objected to, and, when such is the case, a <i>concentrated</i>
solution of hyposulphite of soda must be used, in
order to dissolve off the white hyposulphite of silver before
it begins to decompose. When the proofs are taken at
once from the printing frame and immersed in a <i>dilute</i>
bath of hyposulphite (one part of the salt to six or eight of
water), <i>a shade of brown</i> may often be observed to pass
over the surface of the print, and a large deposit of sulphuret
of silver soon forms as the result of this decomposition.
On the other hand, with a strong hyposulphite
bath there is little or no discoloration and the black deposit is absent.</p>

<p>But even if, by a preliminary removal of the nitrate of
silver, the danger of blackening be in a great measure
obviated, yet the print must not be taken out of the fixing
bath too speedily, or some appearance of brown patches,
visible by transmitted light, may occur.</p>

<p>Each atom of nitrate of silver requires <i>three</i> atoms of
hyposulphite of soda to form the <i>sweet and soluble double
salt</i>, and hence, if the action be not continued sufficiently
long, another compound will be formed almost tasteless
and insoluble. Even immersion in a new bath of hyposulphite
of soda does not fix the print when once the yellow
stage of decomposition has been established. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[-120-]</a></span>
yellow salt is insoluble in hyposulphite of soda, and consequently
remains in the paper.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid maybe formed by oxidizing sulphur with
boiling nitric acid; but this plan would be too expensive
to be adopted on a large scale. The commercial process
for the manufacture of sulphuric acid is exceedingly ingenious
and beautiful, but it involves reactions which are
too complicated to admit of a superficial explanation. The
sulphur is first burnt into gaseous sulphurous acid (SO{2}),
and then, by the agency of binoxide of nitrogen gas, an
additional atom of oxygen is imparted from the atmosphere,
so as to convert the SO{2} into SO{3}, or sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Anhydrous sulphuric acid is a white crystalline
solid. The strongest liquid acid always contains
one atom of water, which is closely associated with it, and
cannot be driven off by the application of heat.</p>

<p>This <i>mono-hydrated</i> sulphuric acid, represented by the
formula HO SO{3}, is a dense fluid, having a specific gravity
of about 1·845; boils at 620°, and distils without decomposition.
It is not volatile at common temperatures, and
therefore does not <i>fume</i> in the same manner as nitric or
hydrochloric acid. The concentrated acid may be cooled
down even to zero without solidifying; but a weaker compound,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[-121-]</a></span>
containing twice the quantity of water, and termed
<i>glacial</i> sulphuric acid, crystallizes at 40° Fahr. Sulphuric
acid is intensely acid and caustic, but it does not destroy
the skin or dissolve metals so readily as nitric acid. It
has an energetic attraction for water, and when the two
are mixed, condensation ensues, and much heat is evolved;
four parts of acid and one of water produce a temperature
equal to that of boiling water. Mixed with aqueous
nitric acid, it forms the compound known as nitro-sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid possesses intense chemical powers, and
displaces the greater number of ordinary acids from their
salts. It <i>chars</i> organic substances, by removing the elements
of water, and converts alcohol into ether in a similar
manner. The <i>strength</i> of a given sample of sulphuric
acid may generally be calculated from its specific
gravity, and a table is given by Dr. Ure for that purpose.</p>

<p><i>Impurities of Commercial Sulphuric Acid.</i>&mdash;The liquid
acid sold as <i>oil of vitriol</i> is tolerably constant in composition,
and seems to be as well adapted for photographic
use as the <i>pure</i> sulphuric acid, which is far more expensive.
The specific gravity should be about 1·836 at 60°.
If a drop, evaporated upon platinum foil, gives a fixed residue,
probably bisulphate of potash is present. A milkiness,
on dilution, indicates sulphate of lead.</p>

<p><i>Test for Sulphuric Acid.</i>&mdash;If the presence of sulphuric
acid, or a soluble sulphate, be suspected in any liquid, it
is tested for by adding a few drops of dilute solution of
chloride of barium, or nitrate of baryta. A white precipitate,
<i>insoluble in nitric acid</i>, indicates sulphuric acid. If
the liquid to be tested is very acid, from nitric or hydrochloric
acid, it must be largely diluted before testing, or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[-122-]</a></span>
crystalline precipitate will form, caused by the sparing
solubility of the chloride of barium itself in acid solutions.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Sulphurous Acid.</span></p>

<p>Symbol, SO{2}. Atomic weight, 32.</p>

<p>This is a gaseous compound, formed by burning sulphur
in atmospheric air or oxygen gas; also by heating oil of
vitriol in contact with metallic copper, or with charcoal.</p>

<p>When an acid of any kind is added to hyposulphite of
soda, sulphurous acid is formed as a product of the decomposition
of hyposulphurous acid, but it afterwards disappears
from the liquid by a secondary reaction, resulting in
the production of trithionate and tetrathionate of soda.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Sulphurous acid possesses a peculiar and
suffocating odor, familiar to all in the fumes of burning
sulphur. It is a feeble acid, and escapes with effervescence,
like carbonic acid, when its salts are treated with
oil of vitriol. It is soluble in water.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><i>Water.</i></p>

<p>Symbol, H{2}O. Atomic weight, 9.</p>

<p>Water is an oxide of hydrogen, containing single atoms
of each of the gases.</p>

<p><i>Distilled water</i> is water which has been vaporized and
again condensed: by this means it is freed from earthy
and saline impurities, which, not being volatile, are left
in the body of the retort. <i>Pure</i> distilled water leaves no
residue on evaporation, and should remain perfectly clear
on the addition of nitrate of silver, <i>even when exposed to the
light</i>; it should also be neutral to test-paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[-123-]</a></span></p>

<p>The condensed water of steam-boilers sold as distilled
water is apt to be contaminated with oily and empyreumatic
matter, which discolors nitrate of silver, and is therefore
injurious.</p>

<p><i>Rain-water</i>, having undergone a natural process of distillation,
is free from inorganic salts, but it usually contains
a minute portion of <i>ammonia</i>, which gives it an
alkaline reaction to test-paper. It is very good for photographic
purposes if collected in clean vessels, but when
taken from a common rain-water tank should always be
examined, and if much organic matter be present, tinging
it of a brown color and imparting an unpleasant smell, it
must be rejected.</p>

<p><i>Spring</i> or <i>river</i> water, commonly known as "hard
water," usually contains sulphate of lime, and carbonate
of lime dissolved in carbonic acid: also chloride of sodium
in greater or less quantity. On boiling the water, the
carbonic acid gas is evolved, and the greater part of the
carbonate of lime (if any is present) deposits, forming an
earthy incrustation on the boiler.</p>

<p>In testing water for sulphates and chlorides, acidify a
portion with a few drops of <i>pure</i> nitric acid, free from
chlorine (if this is not at hand, use pure acetic acid); then
divide it into two parts, and add to the first a <i>dilute</i> solution
of chloride of barium, and to the second nitrate of
silver,&mdash;a milkiness indicates the presence of sulphates in
the first case or of chlorides in the second. The <i>photographic
nitrate bath</i> cannot be used as a test, since the iodide
of silver it contains is precipitated on dilution, giving a
milkiness which might be mistaken for chloride of silver.</p>

<p>Common hard water can often be used for making a
nitrate bath when nothing better is at hand. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[-124-]</a></span>
chlorides it contains are precipitated by the nitrate of silver,
leaving soluble <i>nitrates</i> in solution, which are not injurious.
The carbonate of lime, if any is present, neutralizes
free nitric acid, rendering the bath alkaline in the
same manner as carbonate of soda. Sulphate of lime,
usually present in well water, is said to exercise a retarding
action upon the sensitive silver salts, but on this point
the writer is unable to give certain information.</p>

<p>Hard water is not often sufficiently pure for the developing
fluids. The chloride of sodium it contains decomposes
the nitrate of silver upon the film, and the image
cannot be brought out perfectly. The New River water,
however supplied to many parts of London, is almost free
from chlorides and answers very well. In other cases a
few drops of nitrate of silver solution may be added to
separate the chlorine, taking care not to use a large excess.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Black Varnish.</span></p>

<p><i>Asphaltum, dissolved in Spirits or Oil of Turpentine.</i>&mdash;The
asphaltum may be coarsely pulverized and put into
a bottle containing the turpentine, and in a few hours, if it
be occasionally shaken, it will be dissolved and ready for
use. It should be of about the consistency of thick paste.</p>

<p>I use the above, but will now give two more compositions,
for any who may wish to adopt them:</p>

<p><i>Black Japan.</i>&mdash;Boil together a gallon of boiled linseed
oil, 8 ounces of amber, and 3 ounces of asphaltum. When
sufficiently cool, thin it with oil of turpentine.</p>

of hot boiled linseed oil, and when sufficiently cool, add a
gallon of oil of turpentine.</p>

number 16.</p>

<p><i>Black Varnish.</i>&mdash;I generally purchase this from the
dealer; but I have made an article which answered the
purpose well, by dissolving pulverized asphaltum in
spirits of turpentine. Any of the black varnishes can be
improved by the addition of a little bees'-wax to it. It is
less liable to crack and gives an improved gloss.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, it has been thought advisable
to remark, that one of the most important departments
of Photography is the practice of its chemistry. Many
of the annoying failures experienced by those who are
just engaging in the practice of the art, arise from the
want of good and pure chemical agents, and the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[-126-]</a></span>
certain way to avoid this, is to purchase them only from
persons who thoroughly understand both their nature and
mode of application. As many who may read this work
might wish to know the prices of the various articles
employed in the practice of the processes given, they can
be informed by addressing the author, who will furnish
them with a printed Price List.</p>

<div class="hanging">LEWIS'S PATENT VICES FOR HOLDING THE GLASS&mdash;CLEANING
AND DRYING THE GLASS&mdash;COATING&mdash;EXPOSURE IN
THE CAMERA&mdash;DEVELOPING&mdash;FIXING OR BRIGHTENING&mdash;BACKING
UP, &amp;C.</div>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Manipulations.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MANIPULATIONS.</div>

<p>Under the head of manipulations I give the method I
employ, and avoid confusion by omitting all comments
upon the thousand suggestions of others.</p>

<p>The glass is to have its sharp edges and corners removed,
by drawing a file once or twice over it. The article used
for holding the glass is called a vice. This vice is firmly
secured to a bench.</p>

<p>[Since the foregoing pages have been in type there has
been introduced into market a new patent vice, adopted
both for glass and plate blocks. I find it, although a
little more expensive, an article better suited to the
wants of the operator or amateur. It is called Lewis's
Patent Glass Vice.]</p>

<p>Clasp the glass firmly in the vice, and pour or <i>spurt</i>
upon it a little alcohol and rotten stone, previously formed
into a paste, and then, with a piece of cotton flannel, the
same as used in the daguerreotype, rub the glass until it
is perfectly cleansed from all foreign substances, which
will soon be known by experience. The rotten stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[-130-]</a></span>
paste should not be allowed to dry while rubbing, as it is
more liable to scratch the glass. I use another small bottle
containing clear alcohol, which I spurt upon the glass,
to obviate the drying.</p>

<p>When the glass has been sufficiently cleaned, it should,
while wet, be put in a vessel of water for future rinsing.
Clean, as before, as many plates of glass as may be required,
and when enough are ready, rinse them off in
the water, and then in a quantity of clean water, or a running
current, give them a second thorough rinsing, and
set them aside to drain.</p>

<p>A convenient method of doing this, is to drive two nails
horizontally into the wall or partition, a sufficient distance
apart (say about 2&frac12; inches) for the glass to rest on: the
upper corner of the glass should be placed against the
wall, and the extreme lower diagonal corner left hanging
between the nails&mdash;which will probably be found the best
position for draining yet suggested.</p>

<p>After drying, they may be put into a box for safe and
clean keeping. Particular caution is necessary to avoid
handling the glass during the operation. I never take the
glass between my fingers, so that they come in contact
with <i>both sides</i> of it, except at one particular corner,
as at Figs. A and B. A quantity of glass prepared as
above, may be kept on hand for use two or three days, and
when wanted they should be again put into the vice<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[-131-]</a></span>
cleaned, first with cotton flannel wet with alcohol, and
then with dry flannel; and then, at a temperature slightly
above that of the surrounding atmosphere, except in cases
where the thermometer stands above 70°, it is ready for the
brush,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> which should be carefully applied to each surface,
to free it from all particles of dust, and then it is ready for
the film of collodion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> The vice should be thoroughly cleansed, and no particles of rotten
stone, or other matter, be allowed to come in contact with the glass, as it
might adhere to the edges and wash off into the silvering bath, and ultimately
cause specks. Always remember that cleanliness is an indispensable
requisite in order to produce a good picture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> One of the most desirable articles I have found for this purpose is the
wide (3 inch) flat camel's-hair brush often called a blender.</p></div>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/page131.png" width="291" height="160" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. B.</div>
</div>

<p>The glass is held between the thumb and forefinger of
the left hand by the corner 1, Fig. A., 3 and 4 towards
and nearest the body, and as nearly level as possible. I
find this the best position to hold the glass; as, in the case of
the larger ones, they can be rested on the end of the little
finger, which should be placed as near the edge as possible.
Then, from the collodion vial, pour on the collodion,
commencing a little beyond the centre and towards 1,
continuing pouring in the same place until the collodion
nearly reaches the thumb&mdash;the glass slightly inclined that
way; then let the glass incline towards 4, and continue
to pour towards 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[-132-]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as enough has been put on to liberally flow the
glass, rapidly and steadily raise corner 1, and hold it directly
over 3, where the excess will flow oil into the mouth
of the vial, which should be placed there to receive it. In
case of a speck of dust falling at the time of coating, it can
often be prevented from injuring the surface by changing
the direction of the flowing collodion, so as to stop it
in some place where it will not be seen when the picture
is finished. Now, with the thumb and finger of the right
hand, I wipe off any drops or lines of collodion that may
be found upon the <i>outer</i> edge or side of the glass, being
careful not to disturb that connected with the face.</p>

<p>When the coating has become sufficiently dry, so that
when I put my finger against it, it does not break the film,
but only leaves a print, I put it into the silvering bath
[<i>see</i> Fig. p. 34]. I generally try corners 2 and 3. The
time, from the first commencement of pouring on collodion
to its being put into the bath, should not exceed about
half a minute, at a temperature of 60°. The finger
test is the best I have found. The glass is to be rested
on a dipper [<i>see</i> Fig. p. 34], and placed steadily and firmly
into the nitrate of silver bath&mdash;this in a dark room. It
should not be allowed to rest for an instant as it is entering
the solution, or it would cause a line. The time for
the glass to remain in the bath depends upon the age and
amount of silver the bath contains; for a new solution,
from <i>two</i> to <i>three</i> minutes will be sufficient to give the
proper action. If it be old, three to five minutes will be
better. When it is properly coated, it can be raised up
and taken by the corner, and allowed to drain for a few
seconds, and then should be placed in the tablet, and is
ready for the camera. The time of exposure will depend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[-133-]</a></span>
upon the amount of light present. If the bath is newly
mixed, and the collodion recently iodized, it should produce
a sufficiently strong impression by an exposure of
about one-third of the time required for a daguerreotype.
If the collodion has been iodized some time, and the bath
is old, about one-half of the time necessary to produce a
daguerreian image will be required.</p>

<p>The plate should in no case be allowed to become dry
from the time it is taken from the bath up to the time of
pouring on the developer. At a temperature of about 70°,
I have had the glass out of the bath ten minutes without
drying. After exposure, the glass should be taken again
into the dark room, and removed from the tablet and held
over a sink, pail, or basin and the developing solution
poured on it as follows: hold the glass between the
thumb and finger of the left hand, by the opposite end
corner from that in coating with collodion, <i>i. e.</i>, 2, and let
3 and 4 be from you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANIPULATIONS OF THE POSITIVE PROCESS.</div>

<p>Commence pouring on the developing solution at the
end by the thumb, and let it flow quickly and evenly over
the entire surface, the first flooding washing off any excess
of nitrate of silver there may be about the edges or corners
of the glass (if this silver is not washed off, it flows
over the edges and on the surface of the impression, producing
white wavy clouds of scum), and then hold the
glass as nearly level as possible, it having upon its surface
a thin covering of solution (care should be observed
not to pour the developing solution on the plate in <i>one
place</i>, as it would remove all the nitrate of silver and prevent
the development of the image, leaving only a dark
or black spot where it is poured on). Put down the bottle
containing the developing solution, and take up a quart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[-134-]</a></span>
pitcher previously filled with water, and as soon as the
outline of the image can be plainly seen by the weak or
subdued light of an oil or fluid lamp or candle, pour the
water over copiously and rapidly. Continue this until all
the iron solution has been removed. If this is not done,
the plate will be covered with blue scum on the application
of the washing solution. Then the glass can be taken
into a light room, and the iodide of silver coating washed
off with the cyanide solution, and then rinsed with clear
pure water, and stood in a position to drain and dry. I
place a little blotting paper under them: it aids in absorbing
the water, and facilitates the operation.</p>

<p>Place the face of the glass against the wall, in order to
prevent dust from falling upon it. I have often dried the
coating by holding or standing the glass adjacent to a
stove. A steady heat is advisable, as it leaves the surface
in a more perfect state, and free from any scum. After
the coating is perfectly dry, it is ready for the preserving
process. It should be warmed evenly, and when about
milk warm, "Humphrey's Collodion Gilding" is poured
on the image in precisely the same manner as the collodion.
In a few seconds the coating sets, and after three-quarters
of a minute, if it has not become dry, the blaze
of a spirit lamp may be applied to the back and it will
immediately become <i>perfectly transparent</i>, and nearly as
hard as the glass itself: the effect is fully equal, if not superior,
to that of chloride of gold in gilding the daguerreotype
image. The surface becomes brilliant and permanent.
The back of the glass can now be wiped and
cleaned with paper or cloth, and gently warmed, and then
with a common small brush one coat of black varnish can
be applied. This brush should be drawn from side to side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[-135-]</a></span>
across the glass, and on the side opposite to that which has
received the image.</p>

<p>This is in order not to make streaks in the coating of
varnish, but to have uniform lines across the entire length
or breadth of the glass. If the varnish is of the proper
consistency, it will flow into a smooth, even coating.
After this first coating is dry, apply a second in the same
manner, only in an opposite direction, so as to cross the
lines of the first, uniting at right angles; when this last
coating is very nearly dry, a piece of paper, glazed black
on one side, and cut to the proper size, can be put next the
varnish; it gives it a clean finish, at the same time that
it aids towards a dense blackening.</p>

<p>I sometimes apply the black varnish by flowing, in the
same manner as in putting on the collodion.</p>

<p>This picture is to be colored and put up in the same
manner as the daguerreotype image, with a mat and glass.
The last glass may be dispensed with by first using the
collodion gilding, and then upon its surface apply the black
varnish, as before. In this case the image is seen through
the same glass it is on, and without being reversed: in
this case the mat goes on the outside of the glass.</p>

<p>When the image is seen through the glass upon which
it is taken, it cannot be colored with very great success, as
it cannot be seen through the reduced silver forming it.
This forms a more or less opaque surface; but in point of
economy the single glass is preferable. Yet I would not
recommend such economy, for I consider that a good impression
ought to be well put up, and the welfare of the
art fully substantiates that consideration.</p>

<p>Many ways have been devised for putting up pictures
I have produced pleasing effects upon colored glasses: for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[-136-]</a></span>
instance, a picture on a light purple glass has a very pleasing
effect; also in some other colors. I have also used
patent leather for backing the image.</p>

<p>I have produced curious and interesting results by
placing a piece of white paper, or coloring white the
back of the <i>whites</i> of the image, and then blackening
over or around this. By this means the whites are preserved
very clear.</p>

<p><i>Positives for Pins, Lockets, etc.</i>&mdash;I employ mica for
floating the collodion on, as it can be as easily cut and
fitted as the metallic plate in the daguerreotype; and
positives taken upon fine, clear, transparent mica, are
fully equal to those taken upon glass, and yet they are
ambrotypes.</p>

<p>Mica is an article familiar to every one, as being used
in stoves, gratings, etc.</p>

<p>The method of using it, is to take the impression on a
thick piece, and then split it off, which can readily be
done in the most perfect, thin, transparent plates; it is
equally as thin as tissue paper, and can be cut as easily.
The thickness of the piece upon which the impression is
taken is of no moment, since it can be reduced at pleasure
and is more easily handled while thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[-137-]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Observations on the Positive Collodion Process.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fogging.</span>&mdash;There are numerous causes which will produce
fogging: the principal ones will be mentioned. One
is the admission of light upon the collodion. This maybe
from a want of closeness of the dark room, the tablet,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
the camera, or by accidental exposure. The method to
locate the particular cause is to, <i>first</i>, when the glass is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[-138-]</a></span>
taken from the nitrate bath, let it stand for sufficient time
to drain, then pour on the developer, and if the coating
assumes a mistiness, or light-grey color, the fault is in the
dark room; again, if the plate, after it has been treated
with the developer and fixed, is clear, then also the fault
is there. Now try the tablet in the same manner, and if
not there, try the camera, and the proper location will be
found.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Since the foregoing pages have been in type an entirely new feature in
the line of apparatus has been introduced; this is W. &amp; W. H. Lewis's Patent
Plate-holder with solid glass corners. These Holders have every requisite
for excluding the light from the sensitive surface; they are accompanied
with a "shut off," so that when the slide is drawn no light can reach the
glass. This, in connection with the unequalled advantage of the solid
corners, makes them the most desirable article for the Operator.
<i>Humphrey's Journal</i>, in referring to these Holders, says:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We are always glad to note every step which our mechanics make
towards improvement on the apparatus used by our practical
photographic operators, and make the present announcement of one
which has only to be known to be readily understood, and to be seen
to be appreciated. A patent has recently been granted for making
solid glass corners, which are to be attached to plate-holders,
and form the most perfect article that has ever been introduced.
Heretofore the operator has had the corners of his plate-holders
made with separate pieces of glass, cut so as to fit the corners of
his frames; these are only glued or grooved in, and are constantly
coming apart, falling out, and annoying in many ways; for our part,
we never have considered them as fit for use in any manner. We look
upon the present improvement as destined to entirely supersede all
the methods heretofore introduced. In this case the collodionized
or albumenized plate can come in contact with no other substance
than a single piece of glass, and consequently there is far less
liability of accident from either the staining of the plate or
breaking of the holder. The rapid favor this improvement has gained
already shows its great advantage over all other methods heretofore
employed."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Decomposition by exposure to light or by long keeping,
even in the dark. The author conceives that it is possible
for organic matter alone to produce, after a time, a
partial decomposition of solution of nitrate of silver, sufficient
to prevent it from being employed chemically neutral,
but probably not much interfering with its properties
in other respects.</p>

<p>"Use of rain water or of water containing carbonate of
silver being perfectly neutral and from nitric acid. This
difficulty is not a theoretical one only, but has actually
been experienced. Rain water usually contains ammonia,
and has a faint alkaline reaction. Pump water often
abounds with carbonate of lime, much of which, but not
the whole, is deposited on boiling. To remove the alkaline
condition, add acetic acid, one drop to half a pint of
the solution.</p>

<p>"Partial decomposition of the bath, by contact with
metallic iron, with hyposulphite of soda, or with any developing
agent, even in small quantity. Also by the use
of accelerators, which injure the bath by degrees, and
eventually prevent its employment in an accurately neutral
state.</p>

<p>"Vapor of ammonia, or hydrosulphate of ammonia,
escaping into the developing room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[-139-]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spots.</span>&mdash;One principal cause of spots is <i>dust</i>. The operating
room should be kept as free from this as possible,
and instead of its being dusted, it should be wiped with a
damp cloth. Specks or flakes of iodide of silver are often
found in the nitrate bath. These sometimes occur by an
ever-iodized collodion, and sometimes by collodion falling
off while being silvered. When this occurs, the nitrate of
silver solution should be filtered. A new sponge or a tuft
of cotton is a good article to filter nitrate of silver solution
through. A small particle of light finding its way upon
the plate, will produce a spot. Another and very frequent
cause is, putting the slide of the tablet down rapidly, causing
it to spatter upon the plate the solution which has
drained off from it. This paper will be opaque when
viewed by reflected light, and dark when viewed
by transmitted light. Occasionally a sort of transparent
spot will appear: this may be traced to a want of sensibility
of the iodide of silver. Large transparent spots
frequently appear by the operator's pouring the developing
solution upon one place, and washing off the small quantity
of nitrate of silver necessary to develope the image. This
will be easily detected, and can be obviated by <i>flooding</i>
the most of the surface of the glass with a steady stream
of the developer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stains and Lines.</span>&mdash;If the glass be allowed to rest for
an instant with one portion of its surface in the silvering
solution and the other out of it, it would cause a streak
across; hence the necessity of totally immersing it with
one firm, steady motion removing the glass before it has
been thoroughly wetted, and the ether and alcohol allowed
a uniform action over the entire surface. A plate should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[-140-]</a></span>
not be disturbed in the bath until it has been in a full
minute at least.</p>

<p><i>Irregular Lines</i> are often caused by using the developing
solution too strong, or by not pouring it evenly over
the plate at once. Should it be allowed to rest in its progress,
if but for an instant, it will leave its line. Sometimes
spangles of metallic silver appear: these are caused
by the presence of too much nitric acid in the developer
for the proportion of iodide in the film and the strength
of the bath.</p>

<p>There are other phases connected with the practice of
the positive process, which it would be almost impossible
to commit to paper, and cannot be so explained as to be
perfectly comprehended by the new experimenter. It is
absolutely necessary for all to observe every little point
noticed in the foregoing pages, and at the same time exercise
some good judgment, and no one need hesitate through
fear of not being successful.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Negative Process.</span></p>

<p>The manipulations and chemicals employed in the production
of the negative collodion pictures are very similar
to those already given for operating by the positive process;
frequent reference will therefore necessarily be
made to portions of that process, as described in the preceding
pages, and only such parts will be given here, as
do not correspond with the foregoing.</p>

<p>It is thought advisable to omit in this chapter every reference
that does not have a desired tendency to aid the
operator in the plain straightforward order of manipulation.
The negative process is fast becoming popular and
needs the attention of all who desire to keep pace with
the experiments in the art. Since the first edition of this
work it has been my pleasure to see many fine photographic
specimens produced by the following process, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[-144-]</a></span>
one need fail, if he will carefully adhere to the details
given.</p>

<p>There perhaps may be circumstances making it advisable
for some to have but one nitrate of silver solution for
both positive and negative collodion pictures: for such, a
process will be given in the following pages, which has
recently appeared in <i>Humphrey's Journal</i>, and is called, after
its author, the "Helio Process," this is well adapted for
most purposes.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Soluble Cotton.</span></p>

<p>The method for preparing this has been given in page
41. It is prepared in the same manner for both positives
and negatives.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Plain Collodion.</span></p>

<p>The preparation of plain collodion employed is the same
as that described at <a href="#Page_53">page 53</a>.</p>

<p>A little alcohol may be added to make it flow more evenly
over the plate&mdash;say 1 oz.</p>

<p>This solution can be kept in a pint bottle, and should
have a funnel devoted solely to the purpose of filtering it.
One of the most convenient dishes for receiving this solution,
when poured over the plate, is a bowl with a lip to
it, as it can be readily poured back into the funnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[-145-]</a></span></p>

<p>The mode of employing this developer is the same as
that for positives, described at <a href="#Page_133">page 133</a>. It may be used
an indefinite number of times, but should be kept clean;
it soon assumes a red color.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Re-developing Solution.</span></p>

<p>This solution is for the purpose of giving increased intensity
to the negative, but as its use in the hands of beginners
is attended with some difficulty, I would not
recommend the operator to try it until he has had considerable
experience in the developing process, or he will
undoubtedly spoil his proofs. Its use requires promptness
of action and quick observation.</p>

<p>The following is the formula for its preparation:</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">

  <td class="tdl">Protosulphite of iron</td>
  <td class="tdr">400</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>

</table>

<p>Put this into a bottle, and when the crystals are dissolved,
it is ready for use. It should be kept filtered, and can be
used only once. Now in another bottle put</p>

  <td class="tdr">48</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;The impression is to be well washed after
the developing solution has been poured off, and then the
<i>re-developing solution</i> (that portion containing the protosulphate
of iron) can be poured on&mdash;the plate being held perfectly
level: the surface is completely covered; the water
containing the nitrate of silver should then be poured
<i>rapidly</i> on, to mix with the iron, when the surface of the
impression will instantly commence to blacken; and if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[-146-]</a></span>
action be allowed to continue for a lengthened period, say
one minute, the impression will be ruined.</p>

<p>It is a matter worthy of notice, that there is no perceptible
action when the iron solution is poured over the
glass; but the action is very energetic the instant the nitrate
of silver solution comes in contact with the iron salt
and the silver.</p>

<p>As soon as any change can be observed, after the re-developer
has been poured over the plate, it should be
<i>quickly</i> and copiously washed off with clean water, and
then it is ready for the fixing process.</p>

<p>I would dissuade novices in the art from practising with
the <i>re-developing solution</i>, until they have first thoroughly
mastered the entire process of taking negatives. The developing
solution is the only one used by operators generally,
and will, with proper care, produce satisfactory results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;This is nearly a saturated solution. The
glass can be put in a dish and the solution poured over, or
held in the hand, in the same way as the plate in the daguerreotype
process. It can readily be seen when a sufficient
action has been attained, as the unaltered bromo-iodide
of silver will be dissolved, leaving only the reduced
surface holding the image.</p>

<p>This action should not be continued too long, as it affects
the intensity of the picture, injuring it for printing.</p>

<p>The glass should be well washed by pouring over it
clean water, and then it can be stood away to dry, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[-147-]</a></span>
<i>nearly</i> perpendicular position, on clean blotting paper, or
otherwise, as is most convenient; when thoroughly dry, it
is ready for the finishing.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Finishing the Image.</span></p>

<p>This is done with the same material, and in the same
manner, as that given for positives&mdash;<a href="#Page_134">page 134</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;The glass negatives, when not wanted for
use, should be carefully put aside in a box, and kept free
from dust and dampness: by so doing, it is believed that
they will remain good for any length of time.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Nitrate of Silver Bath.</span></p>

<p>This solution differs only from the positive bath, by
omitting the <i>nitric acid</i>: in all other respects it is precisely
the same, and is prepared by the same formula, as given
at <a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>.</p>

<p>This is called the <i>neutral bath</i>, and is best adapted to
the negative process. The nitrate of silver employed in
its preparation should be perfectly free from excess of
nitric acid, otherwise the whole solution will be slightly
acid.</p>

<p>If it should not be convenient to obtain nitrate of silver
without this objection, the acid may be neutralized by putting
into the solution a small quantity of common washing soda&mdash;
say 1 grain to each 100 grains of nitrate of silver&mdash;previously
dissolved in about half an ounce of water. This
may be put in at the same time that the iodide of potassium
is, and it would save one filtration.</p>

<p>In twenty samples of nitrate of silver that I have tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[-148-]</a></span>
the above quantity of soda has been found sufficient; if,
however, the <i>white</i> precipitate first formed is re-dissolved
on shaking the mixture, free nitric acid is present, and
more of the soda may be added.</p>

<p>This bath will improve by age, and be less liable to fog
after having been in constant use for one or two weeks.</p>

<p>Operators who have the means, and design following
the art professionally, will find it to their advantage to
make from two to three times the quantity of solution they
require for immediate use: by this means they will be
enabled to replenish their stock, which may be used up or
otherwise lost.</p>

<p>There is probably no department of the photographic
art where can be found an equal amount of variety, as
regards chemicals, manipulations, etc. The course adopted
in the commencement, of giving only one process for the
operator to work by&mdash;and that a good one&mdash;will be strictly
adhered to in this place. I have produced as good positives
on paper by the following plan, as I have ever seen.
Should the reader wish more extensive acquaintance with
the printing processes, he is referred to
 <span class="smcap">Humphrey's Journal</span>.</p>

<p>The water is put into a flat, gutta-percha, glass, or
earthen dish, and the muriate of ammonia is put into it,
and stirred until it is dissolved and is well mixed with the
water; then proceed as follows: we will suppose we have
a gutta-percha dish sufficiently large to take in a sheet of
paper 8 by 10 inches, and about 1&frac12; or 2 inches deep:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[-152-]</a></span>
take hold of two corners of the paper with the thumb and
finger of each hand, and then draw the paper through the
solution, by passing it from one end of the dish to the
other, so that it will be wetted on both sides; then turning
it over in the same manner, draw it back, so that its
surface will be thoroughly moistened, but it is not necessary
to <i>saturate</i> the paper. Now the paper is ready for
drying, which may be done by hanging it on the edge of
a shelf by means of little tack nails put through it at the
same corners by which it was held in passing through the
salting solution. In order to prevent streaks, from forming
upon the paper, it is better to hang it in such a manner
that it cannot touch the shelf, except at the corners:
say the sheet is eight inches wide, and the tacks (which
are put through the corners) to be only five or six inches
apart, this will give the proper bend outwards, preventing
its contact with the shelf. This entire operation can be
performed in daylight, or otherwise as suits the convenience
of the operator.</p>

<p>This paper, when dry, should be laid between the folds
of blotting paper (filtering paper will answer), and may
be kept for any length of time, and is ready for the silvering
process.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Silvering Paper.</span></p>

<p>In silvering paper, I employ the ammonio-nitrate, which
is prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Water</td>
  <td class="tdr">2&frac14;</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of silver</td>
  <td class="tdr">75</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Dissolve (in a 4-ounce vial) the nitrate of silver in the
water, and then pour one-fourth of the solution into an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[-153-]</a></span>
ounce graduate or any convenient vessel: this keep for
farther use in preventing the presence of an excess of
ammonia. Now, into the bottle containing the three-fourths
put about 4 drops of aqua-ammonia; shake well
and a brown precipitate will be given. Continue adding
the ammonia, <i>drop by drop</i>, and shake after each addition,
until the brown precipitate is re-dissolved and the solution
is clear; then pour back into the bottle the one-fourth
taken out at first: this will leave the solution slightly turbid,
and when so, there is no excess of ammonia which
would be objectionable. It may now be filtered through
filtering paper, and it (the clear liquid) is ready for use.
This should be kept in the dark, as it decomposes rapidly
when exposed to light.</p>

<p>The method of silvering the paper with ammonio-nitrate
of silver, is as follows: take a tuft of clean cotton, roll it
into a ball-shape, then wet it by holding it against the
mouth of the bottle containing the ammonio-nitrate, and
when well wet, apply it to the paper (which should be
placed flat on a clean board) by gently rubbing it over the
surface, care being taken not to roughen it.</p>

<p>If the solution has not been filtered for some time, it
would be advisable to pour a little on the centre of the
paper, and then distribute it over the surface by means of
the cotton, which is held in the fingers: by this last method
any sediment which may be in the bottom of the bottle is
prevented from getting upon the paper, and causing spots.</p>

<p>I have used a brush for the purpose of distributing the
solution, by which plan there is less liability of getting it
on the fingers and staining them. Care must be taken to
cover the <i>entire surface</i> of the paper, or there will be light
streaks, occasioned by the absence of the silvering solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[-154-]</a></span></p>

<p>This want of silver will appear on the paper in light
parts, as seen in the accompanying cut:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 120px;"><a id="Fig_36"></a>
<img src="images/fig36.png" width="120" height="180" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 36.</div>
</div>

<p>After the paper has been perfectly coated, or washed
with the silvering solution, it should be placed in a perpendicular
position to dry. I usually tack the paper on a
board of the requisite size, and then stand it on one edge
until it has drained and dried. As soon as dry, it is ready for
use. This paper will not keep more than twelve hours,
therefore the operator should silver in the morning the
quantity required for the day. It is imperatively necessary
that the silvered paper be kept in the dark. It is
extremely sensitive to light, and a very brief exposure of
the prepared sheet would render it unfit for use.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Printing the Positive.</span></p>

<p>The several kinds of apparatus used for holding the
negative and the sensitive paper together, have already
been given on <a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>, Figs. <a href="#Fig_31">31</a>, <a href="#Fig_32">32</a>, <a href="#Fig_33">33</a>. The paper having
been salted and silvered, as just described, should be
placed on the pad of the printing frame or glasses, with
its sensitive surface up, and then the negative placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[-155-]</a></span>
directly upon and in contact with it; then it is to be fastened
together, when it will be ready for exposure to the
direct rays of the sun. From 10 to 40 seconds will be
found enough to give a sufficiently intense print.</p>

<p>The paper first changes to a slate color, and then to a
brown or copper color t when of a dark slate color is about
the proper time to take it out and immerse in the toning
bath.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Fixing and Coloring Bath.</span></p>

<p>I have employed the proportions given by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardwich</span>
in his <i>Photographic Chemistry</i>, page 209&mdash;Humphrey's American edition.</p>

<p>"Dissolve the hyposulphite of soda in four ounces of
the water, the chloride of gold in three ounces, the nitrate
of silver in the remaining ounce; then pour the diluted
chloride by degrees into the hyposulphite, stirring meanwhile
with a glass rod; and afterwards the nitrate of silver
in the same way. This order of mixing the solution
is to be strictly observed; if it were reversed, the hyposulphite
of soda being added to the chloride of gold, the result
would be the reduction of metallic gold. The difference
depends upon the fact that the hyposulphite of gold
which is formed is an exceedingly unstable substance, and
cannot exist in contact with unaltered chloride of gold. It
is necessary that it should be dissolved by hyposulphite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[-156-]</a></span>
soda <i>immediately</i> on its formation, and so rendered more
permanent by conversion into a double salt of soda and
gold.</p>

<p>"The <i>time of coloration</i> depends much upon the quantity
of gold present, and may in some cases be extended to
many hours. The results of a few experiments, performed
roughly, appeared to indicate that the activity of this bath
is less affected by depression of temperature than those
prepared with tetrathionate. Certainly the injurious effects
of prolonged immersion are not so evident as with the
first two formulæ: the purity of the whites remains unaltered
for many hours if the bath is new, but with an old bath
there is a tendency to yellowness, which is probably
caused by the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen. Fresh
chloride of gold must be added from time to time, as it
appears to be required."</p>

<p>After the impression has remained in the toning bath a
sufficient length of time, it should be placed in a dish or
sink of clean water, which should be changed several
times&mdash;floating for at least 12 hours; then it may be
taken out and hung up to dry.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Touching.</span>"&mdash;The <i>coloring</i> of a photograph forms no
part of my process: this is a matter to be given into the
hands of an artist, and when it bears the finishing touch
of his skill, it is no longer a <i>photograph</i>, but <i>an oil</i>
or <i>watercolor painting</i>; all the delicate workings of nature having
been lost or hidden under the colors.</p>

<p>A photograph may often be "touched" to advantage.
If, as is frequently the case, there be little white spots
on the face of the paper, they may be readily covered by
the application of a little India ink, with the point of a
wet pencil or fine small brush.</p>

as that used for gilding the daguerreotype. First hold the
rod just above the blaze, then gradually allow it to descend
into it, imparting to the rod a rotatory motion with
the finger and thumb: this will soon cause a softening of
the glass, when it may be bent to any desired shape. If
the ends are to be bent to form hooks, another small
piece of glass, or any warm metal, may be placed
upon the end, in the blaze of the lamp, and as soon as
thoroughly softened, it can be pressed or bent to form the
hook. By filing around a glass tube or rod, it may be
easily and safely broken at the desired point, by giving it
a sudden jerk between both hands, holding it close to the
encircled part.</p>

<p><i>Cementing Glass</i> may be readily accomplished by
placing the two ends together in the blaze of the lamp,
and holding them there until they attain a sufficient degree
of heat to slightly fuse: when cool, the ends will be
found perfectly united.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[-159-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Background</i> best adapted to positives is unbleached
muslin, such, as is sold for sheeting, and can be found in
almost any dry goods' store: it should be from two to
three yards wide. A clouded appearance is given to the
background by merely marking it with <i>charcoal</i>, forming
streaks or "<i>waves</i>" resembling clouds. These come out
black, or dark, in the positive, and give a variegated appearance.
The roughness of the marking does not matter,
since the background is generally a little out of the focus
of the lenses. Trees and other designs may be represented
in this matter.</p>

<p><i>Positive Collodion Pictures</i> may be whitened by the use
of bichloride of mercury, thirty grains to one ounce of water.
After the picture has been developed, fixed and
washed, by the process given in the preceding pages, the
solution of bichloride of mercury may be poured over the
surface of the image: it almost immediately presents a
series of interesting changes in color. The surface at first
blackens but for a few minutes, when it begins to get
lighter, and gradually brightens to a pure white, inclining
to a blue. It should then be thoroughly washed and dried,
as usual.</p>

<p><i>Instantaneous Pictures</i> may be taken by employing the
<i>iodide of iron</i> in the collodion. The best method with
which I am acquainted, is to have a saturated solution of
iodide of iron in alcohol, and drop one or two drops into
an ounce of the collodion (which has been previously
iodized) used in taking positives. This can be used at
once, as soon as mixed. No more of this collodion should
be prepared than is wanted for immediate use, as it will
keep good for only a few hours. The saturated solution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[-160-]</a></span>
iodide of iron can be kept on hand ready for use at all
times. There should be an excess of the iodide in the
alcohol. The same accelerating effect is produced with
the negative collodion prepared in this way.</p>

<p><i>Plain Collodion</i> may be iodized as soon as dissolved:
this will save time in settling. It is a fact that some cotton
is more readily dissolved when the bromo-iodizing is
present: but by the addition of this, I have often taken up
considerable quantities of the gummy sediment remaining
in the bottom of bottles.</p>

<p><i>Prepared Glass</i> may be preserved clean and free from
dust by keeping in boxes such as those used for keeping
daguerreotype plates. By taking out every other partition
between the grooves, the glass can be readily put in.</p>

<p><i>Collodion Vials and Bottles</i>, after having collodion in
them once, should be rinsed with alcohol and ether (in
the same proportions as employed for dissolving the cotton),
before using them a second time for that purpose.
Penuriousness in this respect would be bad policy.</p>

<p><i>Coating Large Glasses.</i>&mdash;A convenient method of doing
this is represented in the following illustration:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/page160.png" width="310" height="139" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The glass is held by one corner, 2; the other corner, 4, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[-161-]</a></span>
rested on a table or bench, and the collodion poured on, so
that the excess may be poured off at 1.</p>

<p><i>Black Stains</i> upon the hands, caused by nitrate of silver,
may be removed by moistening them and rubbing with a
lump of cyanuret of potassium. This salt is poisonous, if
used to a great extent [<i>See <a href="#Page_139">page 139</a></i>]. Another safer, but
more expensive plan, however, is to take a saturated solution
of iodide of potassium in water, and then wash with
nitric acid diluted with two parts water.</p>

<p><i>Stains upon White Linen</i> can be removed by washing
with a saturated solution of iodide of potassium containing
a little iodine; then wash with water, and soak in a saturated
solution of hyposulphite of soda until the yellow
iodide of silver is dissolved.</p>

<p><i>The hands</i> should always be washed after fixing a positive
or negative picture, before again touching a glass to
be coated, or the dipper; this precaution is necessary, lest
any of the iron salt, or the hyposulphite, should get into
the silvering solution and spoil it.</p>

<p><i>In taking Collodion Pictures</i>, it is always advisable for
the sitter to be arranged before the glass is taken from the
bath: this will save time and there will be less liability
of the collodion drying.</p>

<p><i>A Good Negative</i> may be known by its possessing the
following characteristics:&mdash;By transmitted light the figure
is bright, and appears to stand out from the glass; the
dark shadows are clear, without any misty deposit of metallic
silver; the high lights black almost to complete
opacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[-162-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A Glass Coated with Collodion</i>, if kept too long before
immersion in the bath, will not be equally sensitive over
its surface; the parts most dry being the least sensitive.</p>

<p><i>Glass Pans, for Scales</i>, can be procured by every one
at trifling expense: Take a watch crystal, and place in the
common metal pan; balance this with lead, or any weight:
this can easily be kept clean, and is the most advisable
for weighing all deliquescent salts, and chemicals employed
in the collodion process.</p>

<p><i>Caution.</i>&mdash;Persons engaged in making collodion, and
using ether and alcohol, must bear in mind that these chemicals
are <i>very inflammable</i>; hence extreme caution is necessary
to avoid exposing them to the flame of a lamp or
candle. I have known of several serious accidents, of
recent date, all of which were caused by the imprudence
of the experimenter in the particular above mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Wipe the Plate-holder</i> every time before the glass is put
into it: this will prevent spots, which might otherwise
occur from the presence of nitrate of silver solution which
drained from the plate previously used. These spots are
of an opaque yellowish tinge, and in shape resemble the
stain which would be occasioned by a <i>splash</i> of water.</p>

<p><i>Glass jar Positives.</i>&mdash;A good <i>white</i> or light-green glass
will answer for the collodion coating. Glass which contains
air-spots can be used, if it be placed in such a manner
as to let the light of the image come over them, as the
spots cannot be seen through the opaque surface. Only
the best white glass should be used for <i>covering</i> the picture.
Some operators use the convex glass, which is very
clear, and answers the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[-163-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Nitrate of Silver Bath</i> should be kept covered,
except when in use.</p>

<p><i>If a Glass be Immersed too soon</i>, streaks and waves will
be occasioned. These will be seen at the end of the plate
which is least dry: the coating is also more liable to peel
off. It should be borne in mind, however, that the peeling
of collodion is not always attributable to this cause.</p>

<p><i>Diffused Light in the Developing Room.</i>&mdash;In proportion as
the sensitiveness of the plates increases, greater care must
be exercised in thoroughly excluding all rays of white
light. With opalescent films, neutral, this cause of fogging
is more common than any other.</p>

<p><i>Tn the case</i> of a portrait, if the features have an unnaturally
black and gloomy appearance, the dark portions of the
drapery, &amp;c., being invisible, the picture has been <i>underexposed</i>
in the camera.</p>

<p class="tdr">Boston, Oct., 1856.</p>

<p>S. D. Humphrey.</p>

<p><i>Sir</i>,&mdash;As <i>Humphrey's Journal</i> is the only truly progressive
and independent Photographic publication in
America, I feel it the duty of every one to aid its Editor
in furthering the interest of the amateur and practitioner
of the art; and, suiting the action to the word, I present
the following Process as being worthy of confidence, and
having, in my hands, proved eminently satisfactory. I am
surprised to see that Operators and men respectably connected
with the practice of the Art should so far fall beneath
the station of true artists as to advertise to catch
each other, or the verdant ones, by offering this or that
little improvement all "printed complete for five dollars."
As an amateur, and having the good of the science I love
at heart, I now contribute my mite for the benefit of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[-165-]</a></span>
interested; and, following the glorious example of G. B. C.
(who I hope we shall soon hear from again,) in your
last, I say&mdash;God speed!</p>

<p>I shall endeavor to be as minute and concise as possible,
so as to enable any one to adopt and successfully use my
processes.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of Soluble Cotton.</i>&mdash;I put into a Wedgewood
mortar, twelve ounces, by weight, of dry and finely pulverized
nitrate of potash (I use Dupont's refined), and add
to it twelve ounces, by measure, of good commercial sulphuric
acid; I mix these well together by the use of a
glass rod and pestle, so that it forms a paste; I then add,
in small quantities at a time, about 325 grains of good
coarse cotton (this is according to your process), and <i>knead</i>
the mass well for from three to five minutes; and then
cover the mortar with a piece of glass, and let it stand for
twenty or thirty minutes, by which time it will have been
sufficiently acted upon. Then the cotton is to be plunged
into a quantity of clean water and thoroughly washed in
a number of changes of water, so that when it is squeezed
between the folds of blue litmus-paper it will not redden
it; this indicates that the acid has been washed out; I
then place the cotton in a clean strong towel and wring
out all the water I can, then put it into alcohol, then wring
it again, and adopt your plan of not letting it become thoroughly
dry.</p>

<p>The cotton being now ready for use, I dissolve it in the
following mixture, in a bottle of proper size:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Sulphuric ether</td>
  <td class="tdr">10</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Alcohol, 95 per cent.</td>
  <td class="tdr">5</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl" colspan="3">Soluble cotton, enough to make it about as
    thick as cream.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above should be well shaken, and then allowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[-166-]</a></span>
stand for one or two days to settle. This constitutes my
Plain Collodion, and should be poured off into another bottle,
leaving the sediment behind.</p>

<p><i>Iodizing.</i>&mdash;For this purpose I employ the following
preparation:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;<i>Iodide of Silver.</i>&mdash;Dissolve fifty grains of nitrate of
silver, crystals, in two ounces of pure water, and forty
grains of iodide of ammonium in two ounces of pure water;
then pour the two together, shaking the mixture well; let
it settle, which it will do in a few minutes; then pour off
the water carefully, leaving behind all the yellow iodide
of silver; pour again a fresh quantity of water over the
precipitate, and continue this washing for at least six
changes of water; then drain off the water as close as possible
and pour on two ounces of alcohol, which, when drained
off, will leave the powder sufficiently clean for the purpose.</p>

<p><i>B.</i>&mdash;I now dissolve forty grains of bromide of ammonium
and one hundred grains of iodide of ammonium in two
ounces of 95 per cent, alcohol, and then add the iodide of
silver (preparation <i>A</i>), and shake the whole well together,
giving a saturated solution. This is to be filtered through
cotton or paper, when it will be ready for use.</p>

<p><i>C.</i>&mdash;To sixteen ounces of Plain Collodion add from eight
to twelve drops of tincture of iodine (50 grains of dry
iodine dissolved in half an oz. of alcohol) and 14 grains
or drops of fluoride of ammonium; shake the mixture
well; then add all of the solution <i>B</i>; shake it again and
thoroughly; after this has stood for twenty-four hours it
can be used, but will be found better after it has been prepared
one week.</p>

just enough to redden blue litmus-paper; then it is ready
for use, and will improve by age.</p>

<p><i>Developing Solution.</i>&mdash;This formula has proved very
satisfactory in my hands, and I hope will be equally so
with all who give it a trial:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dissolve and filter, and it is ready for use. It is better
to make this developer fresh every other day.</p>

<p><i>Dissolving off the Iodide of Silver.</i>&mdash;Water, about half a
pint; cyanide of potassium, enough to clear the impression
in about thirty seconds&mdash;say a quarter of an ounce.</p>

<p><i>Fixing the Impression.</i>&mdash;I use the article well known to
every good photographer as Humphrey's Collodion Gilding,
and it serves the purpose better than anything that I
I know of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[-168-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Black Varnish.</i>&mdash;I generally purchase this from the
dealer; but I have made an article which answered the
purpose well, by dissolving pulverized asphaltum in
spirits of turpentine. Any of the black varnishes can be
improved by the addition of a little bees'-wax to it. It is
less liable to crack and gives an improved gloss.</p>

<p><i>Negative and Printing Processes.</i>&mdash;Being myself an amateur,
and desiring to study economy and convenience, my
attention has been given to the test of numerous plans
for avoiding the necessity of two baths and silvering solutions
and I feel confident that the amateur will find the
following, in connection with the foregoing Positive Process,
the best adapted to his wants.</p>

<p>The same bath and solution is used for the negative as
for the positive process; and the time of exposure in the
camera should be prolonged a few seconds. I have produced
beautiful negatives, in-doors, in <i>four seconds</i>, and, out-doors,
<i>instantaneously</i>. The manipulation, bath, and developing
solution are precisely the same as those used in the positive
process.</p>

<p><i>Fixing the Negative.</i>&mdash;Place the following mixture in a
well-stoppered bottle:</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Pure Water</td>
  <td class="tdr">6</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Aqua-ammonia, concentrated</td>
  <td class="tdr">1</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounce.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This solution should be poured on the negative and
allowed to remain for about twenty seconds. It should
be borne in mind, that the developing solution (same as
for positives) should be well washed off the glass before
the fixing solution is poured over; after it has remained
on the glass for the time given (20 seconds), the negative
can be washed with clean water and dried; it is then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[-169-]</a></span>
ready for printing. The iodide of silver is not, as in other
processes, dissolved off, but remains on the glass.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the negative is not sufficiently
intense; this result can be obtained by pouring over the
plate the following solution, which should remain for
about three-fourths of a minute:</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Water</td>
  <td class="tdr">8</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of silver</td>
  <td class="tdr">28</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Alcohol</td>
  <td class="tdr">1</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Loaf sugar</td>
  <td class="tdr"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></td>
  <td class="tdc">ounce</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>After this solution is used, I pour over the impression
the developing solution, and then wash well with water.
This re-developing may be repeated two or three times, and
almost any desired intensity obtained.</p>

<p><i>Printing Process&mdash;Salting the Paper.</i>&mdash;Boil the following
mixture in an earthen vessel until it becomes transparent:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Distilled water</td>
  <td class="tdr">12</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Muriate of ammonia</td>
  <td class="tdr">240</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Arrowroot</td>
  <td class="tdr">112</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>After this has been sufficiently boiled, it should be
strained through clean linen or cotton cloth (free from
soap or other substances), and, when cool, it is ready for
coating the paper, which is done by dipping a new clean
sponge into it and rubbing it over one side of the paper,
giving it a uniform coating; but as it is not desirable to
have too much on the paper, it should be rubbed with a clean
sponge until nearly dry; it can then be hung up by the
corner until thoroughly dry, when it can be put into a
portfolio and kept for exciting for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[-170-]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Silvering Solution.</i>&mdash;This solution may be prepared in
the light, but must be used in a dark room:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Distilled water</td>
  <td class="tdr">1</td>
  <td class="tdc">pint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of silver</td>
  <td class="tdr">3&frac34;</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Dissolve and pour into an earthen or gutta-percha dish.
Take the paper (cut to the proper size) and <i>float</i> it on this
solution for about three minutes; care must be observed
that there are no air-bubbles between the solution and the
paper, for this would cause spots. It now can be hung up
to dry, and as soon as dry it may be used. Let me here
repeat, that this operation must be conducted in a dark
room.</p>

<p><i>Fixing and Toning Bath.</i>&mdash;I find that a better effect is
produced if the positive be a little over-printed before being
acted upon by the following mixture:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Distilled water</td>
  <td class="tdr">8</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Chloride of sodium</td>
  <td class="tdr">240</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This solution should be put into a flat dish and the print
placed on it, face down, for from one and a-half to three
minutes, when it should be taken off and put into the following
solution, and allowed to remain there from three
quarters of an hour to two hours:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 20em;" summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Distilled water</td>
  <td class="tdr">18</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Hyposulphite of soda</td>
  <td class="tdr">3</td>
  <td class="tdc">ounces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of silver</td>
  <td class="tdr">60</td>
  <td class="tdc">grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The following method should be observed in preparing
this last mixture, viz.:&mdash;dissolve the three ounces of
hyposulphite of soda in <i>sixteen</i> ounces of the water and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[-171-]</a></span>
the sixty grains of nitrate of silver in the remaining two
ounces; then pour the nitrate of silver solution into that
containing the hyposulphite of soda, stirring the mixture
continually until all is well mixed.</p>

<p>After the print has remained in the toning solution for
the specified time, it should be taken out and well washed
in several changes of clean water, and dried and mounted
in any of the usual ways.</p>

<p>With a few general remarks I will close this, perhaps,
too long communication. It should be a point in the
practice of every one who desires success in any process,
to maintain a strict observance to cleanliness; this is one
point in which most persons fail, and it cannot be too
strongly impressed upon the minds of manipulators. It
should be understood that the foregoing process is <i>complete
in itself</i>, and is not to be confounded with any other method.
The <i>collodion</i> is adapted for the <i>nitrate of silver
bath</i>, and the <i>bath</i> for the <i>collodion</i>; and no one should use
other preparations of collodion and silvering solution, except
they do so with the full expectation that it will be at the
<i>loss of either or both of the preparations employed</i>.</p>

<p>Allow me, through the columns of your invaluable
Journal, to say to those who may read the foregoing process,
that if they find (as I have) my process to prove
profitable to them, I shall consider myself amply repaid if
they will, through the same medium, contribute to our
stock of information by giving an account of their
experiments. I feel quite confident that some of the amateurs,
with whose reputation I am already acquainted, and
of whose private works in photography America has
cause to feel proud,&mdash;could furnish interesting, useful and
valuable information upon this subject. Such men, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[-172-]</a></span>
instance, as G. B. C, of Md. (who has already made a
good beginning), G. W. D., of the same place, and Mr. G.
G., of Pa. Friends and co-laborers, shall we hear from
you? I pause for a reply!</p>

<p>I look with interest upon every stroke of the pen from
your able correspondent G. M., of Washington, whose
specimens of photographic engraving you recently had
the kindness to show me. I assure you, it did not a
little astonish me to witness the surprising truthfulness
with which the details were presented.</p>

<h2><a name="CORRESPONDENCE" id="CORRESPONDENCE"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b></a></h2>

<h3>BETWEEN THE U. S. COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS AND JAMES
A. CUTTING, RELATIVE TO HIS APPLICATIONS FOR LETTERS
PATENT.</h3>

<p class="tdr">
United States Patent Office, April 17, 1854.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Your application for letters patent for an alleged improvement
in making photographic pictures, having been submitted to
the proper examiner, is rejected. As the use of alcohol to absorb
water in hasty desiccation is understood to be commonly practical
in most chemical laboratories, no reference is thought necessary
for the rejection of the first claim.</p>

<p>Secondly, the mixture of alcohol and ether in unlimited proportions
to dissolve gun cotton for photographic purposes, is common.
[<i>See</i> Gaudin's Process, "Humphrey's Daguerreian Journal,"
vol. 4, p. 229.]</p>

<p>Thirdly, collodion with bromide basis, is not new. [<i>See</i> General
Remarks on Collodion, by Gaudin, "Photographic Art Journal,"
1st Series, vol. 6, p. 348.]</p>

<p>The two articles above referred to are translated from the
French, and contain also, it is believed, sufficient to show that
the subject of the fourth claim has been anticipated, rendering
further reference unnecessary.</p>

<p class="tdc">
Respectfully yours, &amp;c.,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap" style="padding-left: 3em;">S. F. Shugert</span>, Acting Commissioner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. A. Cutting</span> (care of C. G. Page), Washington, D. C.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p class="tdr">Jane 17, 1854.<br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In regard to the use of bromide bases with collodion, I
am prepared to show that I had it in successful use in the month
of April, 1853; and if the circumstances require legal proof of
the same, it will be furnished, though at some expense of time
and money to me; and as the question is only between the public
and myself, I trust the office will see fit to grant me a patent
for the same.</p>

<p class="tdr">
United States Patent Office, April 19, 1854.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In your letter of the 17th, you say that, if necessary,
proof can be given that you had in successful use, in the month of
April, 1853, collodion prepared with a bromide oasis. On referring
to the "Journal of the Photographic Society," of London,
No. 6 (June, 1853), page 70, you will see that Sir John Herschel
used bromide for the same purpose previous to the year 1840.
Ammonia, in various combinations, has long been in use for the
preparation of sensitive collodions. [<i>See</i> Report of the British
Association, 1850, p. 150, "Journal of the Photographic Society"
No. 9, 1853, p. 116.] F. M. Lyndes' process and compositions
show that he has used iodine, bromide, and chloride of ammonium;
and Count de Montegon, in the same journal, No. 2, April, 1853;
page 24, for his fifth composition of collodion, used liquid ammonia.
These are all regarded as equivalents for your compositions
covered by the fourth claim; if, however, there is a difference,
you are at liberty to show in what it consists; and the examination
is accordingly postponed to await your action.</p>

<p class="tdc">Yours, &amp;c.,<br />
<span class="smcap" style="padding-left: 9em;">C. Mason</span>, Commissioner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. A. Cutting</span> (care of C. G. Page), Washington, D. C.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="tdr">Washington, June 21, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In reply to your communications of the 19th instant, and
April 17th, 1854, I propose to modify my claims as follows, to
wit:</p>

<p>After the first clause of the claim, nineteenth line, ending with
the words "set forth," add as follows: "I do not claim the use
of alcohol as a <i>desiccating agent</i>, but limit my claim to its special
use and purpose, as herein stated."</p>

<p>Erase the fourth clause of the claim, commencing on the twenty-sixth
line, and ending with the words "set forth" on the thirtieth
line.</p>

<p>In reply to the objection raised by the office that "bromide
was used in 1840," I have to say that I was fully aware of the
employment of bromide in various ways for photographic purposes,
and that I have also, in common with photographers, known
the extreme difficulty of using bromide, and that notwithstanding
the sensitiveness imparted by bromide to other compounds,
it has been almost universally discarded by practical photographers.
The discovery of collodion as a vehicle for sensitive materials
is of recent date, and there seems to have been a backwardness
on the part of photographers to attempt bromide bases
with collodion, and so far, whatever trials have been made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[-175-]</a></span>
subsequent to my discovery, it is evident that they have been
attended with the results of "misty pictures." To whatever
my success may be due, I maintain that I have been the first
to use a bromide base with collodion&mdash;and with that only do I
claim it&mdash;and the results in my pictures show with what success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Your specification of an improvement in composition for
producing photographic pictures is herewith returned for a slight
amendment, which is, to omit the reference to specimens which
do not accompany the patent, and to correct an error in the
oath as noted on the margin.</p>

satisfied that the date there given on which he used bromized collodion
is prior to your claim to having used it; he refers to p. 72,
No, 6, published in June, 1853, for experiments made with bromized
collodion, which paper is dated June 2d, 1853. Mr. Isaac
Rehn, of Philadelphia, has testified to having seen you make use
of a bromide base, viz., bromide of potassium and collodion, about
the 1st of July, 1853, or about one month after the date of Mr.
Crookes' paper in England. The specification is accordingly returned,

<h3>PATENT FOR THE USE OF CAMPHOR IN COMBINATION WITH
IODIZED COLLODION.</h3>

<p>The schedule referred to in the Letters Patent, and making part
of the same.</p>

<p><i>To whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known, that I, <span class="smcap">James A. Cutting</span>, of the City of Boston,
County of Suffolk, and State of Massachusetts, have invented a
new and useful improvement in positive photographic pictures on
glass, and I do hereby declare the following to be an exact description
thereof:</p>

<p>The nature of my invention consists in the use of gum camphor,
in addition to the existing materials in the preparation of collodion
for positive photographic pictures on glass.</p>

<p>To enable others skilled in the art to make and use my invention,
I will proceed to describe the process as follows:</p>

<p>Having prepared the collodion in the usual manner, I take a
pint bottle, in which I introduce twelve ounces of collodion, to
which I add one drachm of iodide of potassium, dissolved in alcohol.
I then shake the mixture thoroughly, and add thereto eighteen
grains of refined gum camphor, shaking the mixture again, until
the whole is combined, then allow it to settle, when it is lit for
use.</p>

<p>The advantages of my improvement consist in the increased
vigor of the delineations of the half-tones of positive pictures on
glass, giving greater depth and rotundity thereto, which render
this combination exceedingly useful for microscopic pictures, as
well as the ordinary purposes of portraiture.</p>

<p>T would have it understood that the combination of camphor
with iodide of potassium and collodion, as above specified, is
adapted solely to the production of positive pictures on glass and
not to the production of negative pictures on glass, from which positive
pictures on paper may be printed, as a sufficient degree of
opacity is not thus afforded for that purpose.</p>

<p>What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters
Patent, is the use of camphor, in combination with iodized
collodion, as set forth in the specification.</p>

<h3>PATENT FOR THE USE OF BALSAM FOR SEALING PHOTOGRAPHIC
PICTURES ON GLASS.</h3>

<p>The schedule referred to in Letters Patent and making part of
the same.</p>

<p><i>To whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">James A. Cutting</span>, of Boston, in the County
of Suffolk and State of Massachusetts, have invented new and
useful improvements in photographic pictures on glass, and I do
hereby declare the following to be an exact description thereof:</p>

<p>The nature of my improvement consists in the application of a
coating of balsam of fir to the side of the glass on which the picture
is made, over which coating I place another glass of equal size
with the one on which the picture is.</p>

<p>To enable others skilled in the art to make and use my invention,
I will proceed to describe the process as follows:</p>

<p>After thoroughly cleaning a glass plate of the same size as that
on which the picture to be secured is made, and moving all dust
from the picture, I hold the glass containing the picture in a horizontal
position with the pictured side uppermost, then apply the
balsam in a line along one edge of the glass and placing one edge of the
second glass in close contact with the first, containing the balsam,
press them gradually together towards the opposite edge, causing
the balsam to flow by a gentle pressure towards the opposite edge,
in this manner excluding all air from between the glasses; then
by an even pressure exclude the superabundant balsam. The advantages
of my improvements are, that by a mechanical combination
of the balsam with the picture it is greatly increased in strength
and beauty, by an additional brilliancy and the exhibition of the
most minute delineations; and by the application of the second
glass in combination with the balsam, the picture is hermetically
sealed and rendered entirely permanent, by being secured
from the influence of both air and moisture, and also from injury
by dust or other extraneous matter, or acid vapors, or any violence
less than what could occasion the fracture of the plate glass.</p>

<p>I am aware of the previous use of balsam for the cementing of
lenses and the securing of microscopic objects, and other like
purposes, and do not therefore extend my claim to any of these
uses; but</p>

<p>What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters
Patent, is the combination of balsam with photographic pictures
on glass, and with additional glass by which they; with the balsam,
are hermetically sealed, as described in the specifications; and
for the purposes therein set forth, and for no other.</p>

<h3>PATENT FOR DISPLACING WATER FROM SOLUBLE COTTON
BY THE USE OF ALCOHOL; ALSO, FOR THE USE OF BROMIDE
OF POTASSIUM IN COMBINATION WITH COLLODION.</h3>

<p>The schedule referred to in these Letters Patent, and making
part of the same.</p>

<p><i>To all to whom these presents shall come:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">James A. Cutting</span>, of Boston, in the
County of Suffolk and State of Massachusetts, have invented
certain improvements in making photographic pictures, and that
the following is a full, clear and exact description of the principle
or character which distinguishes them from all other things before
known, and of the usual manner of making, modifying, and
using the same.</p>

<p>My improvements relate to that class of photographic pictures
in which the pictures are obtained upon a prepared film of glass
or other substance.</p>

<p>The film which I employ is collodion, and in order to insure
success, the collodion must be prepared after my own process, as
follows: Take 3 ounces (Troy) of pure dry nitrate potassa, and
pulverize in a clean glass mortar; add to this 2&frac12; ounces, fluid measure,
of pure sulphuric acid, and stir the mixture with a glass rod;
immerse in this liquid, 80 grains of clean, dry cotton, and knead
the mass of cotton in the liquid for about Ave minutes; remove the
cotton and quickly wash it, till every trace of acid is gone, and
it must then be dried quickly&mdash;for I have discovered that the
more rapidly the cotton is dried, the more sensitive the collodion;
and I have found the best effects produced by displacing the water
from the cotton by strong alcohol.</p>

<p>To prepare the collodion, take 10 ounces concentrated sulphuric
ether, 60° Baumé, and mix this with 6 ounces of 95 per
cent. alcohol. To this mixture add the prepared cotton, in quantity
sufficient to make a collodion as thick as it can, and yet at
the same time flow evenly over the surface of glass. Let it settle
clear, and decant the solution.</p>

<p>In order to "excite" this collodion, take a deep 1 ounce vial&mdash;introduce
2&frac12; grains of bromide of potassium, and add water,
drop by drop, to make a saturated solution. In this solution
dissolve 2&frac12; grains of iodide of potassium, then add 1 ounce of
collodion, and shake well. Let it settle clear and decant for use.</p>

<p>The solution must be decanted every day. In order to make the
most sensitive collodion, I dissolve the bromide and iodide of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[-179-]</a></span>
potassium and the collodion<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> in a saturated solution of carbonate of
ammonia in water. In using this collodion, pour it upon a clean
glass plate to form a film in the usual way, and as soon as the collodion
has set, and before it becomes dry, immerse the plate in a
bath of nitrate of silver, made with 30 grains of nitrate of silver,
2 grains of iodide of silver, and 1 ounce water. Take the plate
directly from the bath to the camera, and after sufficient exposure,
the plate is taken to a dark room to develope the impression with
the following solution: 'Take pyrogallic acid, 4 grains; acetic acid,
No. 8, 1 ounce; dissolve and filter. For use, take of this liquid 1&frac12;
drachms, diluted with 6&frac12; drachms of water, and when the impression
is sufficiently developed, pour off the liquid, and immerse the
plate in a solution of the hyposulphite of soda, 4 ounces to the pint
of water. Wash the plate with pure water, and dry it in the usual
way.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> This is a mistake: the collodion is not to be dissolved in the "carbonate
of ammonia in water," but only the bromide and iodide of potassium. I called
Mr. Cutting's attention to this, and he said I was correct.&mdash;S. D. H.</p></div>

<p>The advantages of the above process are, the brief time required
to produce an impression, and the sharpness of the pictures. Portraits
can be taken with as much facility as with the Daguerreotype,
and the pictures are sharp and of excellent tone. The impression
thus obtained is negative, and the positive picture is produced
in the usual way. I denominate this the mezzographic process.</p>

<p>What I claim as my improvements in the process of obtaining
photographic pictures, are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First.</i> Displacing the water from the cotton, for this purpose,
with strong alcohol, as set forth. I do not claim the use of alcohol
as a desiccating agent, but limit my claim to its special use
and purpose, as herein stated.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The employment of bromide of potassium in combination
with collodion.</p>

<h3>PATENT FOR THE USE OF JAPANNED SURFACES PREVIOUSLY
PREPARED UPON IRON OR OTHER METALLIC OR MINERAL
SHEETS OR PLATES IN THE COLLODION PROCESS.</h3>

<p><i>To all whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Hamilton L. Smith</span>, of Gambier, in the
County of Knox, and State of Ohio, have invented certain new and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[-180-]</a></span>
useful improvements in Photographic Pictures, and I do hereby
declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the
same, and of the manner of making and using my invention or discovery.</p>

<p>The nature of my invention or discovery relates to the taking of
<i>positive</i> pictures by the photographic process, upon a black japanned
surface prepared upon iron or any other metallic plates or
sheets, and consists in the use of collodion, and a solution of a salt
of silver, and an ordinary camera.</p>

<p>To enable others skilled in the art to make and use my invention.
I will proceed to describe the manner of preparing and applying
it which I have found to answer well in practice; not confining
myself, however, to the special process or processes herein
described, so long as the characteristics of the invention remain
the same.</p>

<p>I first take metallic sheets, preferring for the purpose iron, as
this metal is the only one, except the precious metals, which is
without action on the silver salts generally used, as also the other
chemicals; but other metallic or mineral sheets may be used, and
I do not, therefore, confine myself specially to any particular metal.
Upon each of the sheets is prepared a black japanned or
varnished surface, such as is used by tinners or japanners for coating
metallic and other surfaces. The japan or varnish may be
made and applied as follows:&mdash;Take one quart of raw linseed oil;
add to this two ounces of asphaltum and sufficient umber, or lamp
black, to give the desired shade. Boil these ingredients until a
portion dropped on a cool surface will remain in a round spot
without flowing away. It is then thick enough to use. If it
should be too thick, it can readily be thinned with spirits of turpentine.
Apply the japan to the sheets or plates with a brush,
and after allowing it to stand a short time, until the marks of the
brush disappear, place the sheets or plates in a drying oven and
submit them to heat until the surface will bear the finger to be
drawn over it without bringing off the japan; it may, if found necessary,
be coated again and treated in a similar way, and finally
polished with rotten-stone and oil, or other polishing material.
Other ingredients may be used in making the japan, such as mastic,
lac or copal varnish, and other shades of coloring matter may
be used.</p>

<p>By collodion I mean any solution of gun-cotton or pyroxyline;
and by a solution of salt of silver, I mean any of the salts thereof
which can be used in photography for obtaining positive impressions
by a camera.</p>

<p>A japanned surface may be prepared on glass, or on leather and
other fibrous materials. Or glass may be made black by means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[-181-]</a></span>
coloring matter introduced or embodied with the glass, so as to be
<i>in</i> instead of <i>on</i> the glass. But foreseeing the difficulty of embracing
all these applications in one application, I do not desire to
have them so considered; but reserve the right to hereafter apply
for such application of my general principle as I may deem essential,
or of sufficient importance to be protected by Letters Patent.
And it might be proper to add, that vulcanized gutta-percha or
indurated rubber may be used as the basis upon which, or in which
the japanned surface may be made. The invention, however,
consists mainly on the surface, so that a silver picture may be
made upon it, said surface forming the background of the picture.</p>

<p>The ingredients for fixing and developing the positive impression,
upon the japanned surface may be the same as those heretofore
essayed by me in a former application, and need not again be repeated
here. Though other chemicals, or other proportions of the
same chemicals, may be used.</p>

<p>Having thus fully described the nature of my improvement in
photographic pictures, and shown how the same may be accomplished,
what I claim therein as new and desire to secure by Letters
Patent, is:&mdash;</p>

<p>The obtaining <i>positive</i> impressions upon a japanned surface previously
prepared upon an iron or other metallic or mineral sheet or
plate, by means of collodion and a solution of a salt of silver and
a camera, substantially as herein described.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC PICTURES ON OIL.</h3>

<p><i>To all whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Joel Haywood Tatum</span>, of the City of
Baltimore and State of Maryland, have discovered or invented a
new and useful preparation of oil ground or body, and mode of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[-182-]</a></span>
preparing the same by which Photographic impressions, such as
portraits of all sizes, landscapes or still life may be produced upon
such oil prepared ground body or surface, whether upon canvass,
mill-board, pannel, or other body whatever, without any permanent
injury to such body, ground or surface for the reception of
colors in oil (water) or dry (paste), without impairing the texture,
quality, durability, or other desirable quality of the body ground,
or surface rendered so impressible, and give the following as the
Process used in accomplishing the result.</p>

<p>I take ordinary prepared canvass, mill-board, pannel or other
substance for the reception of oil painting by any composition of
oil (or oleaginous substance) and oxide of lead or zinc, Spanish
whiting, Fuller's earth, or their equivalents, singly or in combination,
and after having removed all irregularities or lumps from
the surface I damp or wet the surface with spirits of wine, and
wipe clean; after which, I treat the surface with a solution of
potassium or any good alkali, regulating the strength to the amount
of oil in the body-ground or surface to be treated (ordinarily 1 oz.
of super, carb. soda to 1 pint of water), as soon as the surface has
uniformly changed color allow the surplus solution to run off,
wash off by pouring over the surface clean water, let dry, but not
by the fire or in the sun, as that would bring out the oil to the
surface. When dry, treat the surface again with a solution of the
chloride of sodium (of the strength ordinarily used and prescribed
for paper positives), decant from the surface the superfluous fluid
after a minute, and let dry, as before; remove to a dark room,
and treat the surface with a solution of the nitrate of silver, its
strength being governed by the strength of impression desired,
usually 18 grains of nitrate of silver to 1 oz. of distilled water;
allow the solution to float upon the surface a few moments to
insure uniformity of deposit, and then decant the surplus, in the
bottle or lath; place a small piece of filtering paper on the edge
of the body, and place that, edge down, to facilitate the drainage;
when dry, place the negative impression (which must previously
have been obtained, by the use of the camera, either on collodion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[-183-]</a></span>
or albumen upon glass or upon paper) upon the body or ground to
receive the impression in the position the picture is desired, with
the face of the negative to the surface of the body to receive the
impression. If the negative impression does not cover the whole
surface, then a mat should be used so as to extend to the edge
of the ground on all sides. Expose to the light, and, when sufficiently
long, remove the negative into a dark room (lighted with
a feeble lamp); dash over the impression a weak solution of
hyposulphite of soda, and let stand a few moments; then wash
off with a very dilute acid of only sufficient strength to neutralize
the alkalies remaining upon the surface, usually five or six drops
of sulphuric acid to an oz. of water is sufficient.</p>

<p>What I claim as my own invention and discovery, and desire to
secure by Letters Patent, is the mode of preparing and rendering
oil (oroleaginous) bodies, grounds, or surfaces impressible or sensitive
to the Photographic art by the temporary destruction or chemical
change of the oil or oleaginous matter of the immediate
surface only, by the use of spirits of wine and alkaline solution,
or their equivalents, and, after fixing the impression by the use of
hyposulphate of soda, the use of dilute acid, by which last application
the alkalies are neutralized and the oil restored with the
impression permanent upon the surface.</p>

<p>Disclaiming everything heretofore known in the production of
Photographic pictures upon paper or any unoiled body or surface.</p>

<h3>PATENT FOR MAKING THE BORDER OF THE PICTURE TRANSPARENT,
AND PLACING THE MAT BACK OF THE PICTURE.</h3>

<p><i>To all whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that we, <span class="smcap">Albert Bisbee</span>, of Columbus, in
the County of Franklin and State of Ohio, and <span class="smcap">Y. Day</span>, of Nashville,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[-184-]</a></span>
in the County of Davidson and State of Tennessee, have invented
certain new and useful improvements in photographic
pictures on glass, and we do hereby declare the following to be a
full, clear and exact description of the same.</p>

<p>The nature of our invention consists in making the edges of the
coating or film on the glass transparent so that the picture is made
only on the central part of the glass, and extending so far as to
meet the inside edge of the mat or border, generally used in putting
up such pictures, and then placing the mat back of the picture.</p>

<p>To enable others skilled in the art to make and use our invention,
we will proceed to describe the same as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>We place inside of the camera, and about one-tenth of the focal
distance of the lens from the glass, a board having an aperture of
any desired pattern that we wish the edges to have. This board
shades the edges of the glass, thereby leaving them transparent in
the picture. Then the picture, being taken in the usual manner,
is finished by varnishing with transparent white varnish, and then
backed with japan varnish, care being taken to have the japan on
the back extend only to meet the inside edges of the mat. Then
we place the mat back of the picture and secure it in its place with
the preserver.</p>

<p>If applied to the process, as patented by J. A. Cutting, with two
glasses, the picture is made as above described, and then the second
glass is applied, and finished as before by backing with japan.</p>

<p>The advantage of our improvement, is in having the mat protected
from being soiled, and making the picture appear more round,
causing an illusion as though the picture or image was suspended
in the atmosphere, clear from the background.</p>

<p>Having thus fully described the nature of our invention, what
we claim therein as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is,
making the border of the picture transparent and placing the mat
back of the picture, as described in the above specification, and for
the purpose set forth.</p>

<h3>PATENT FOR THE APPLICATION OF COLORING SUBSTANCES,
OR MATTER, TO PHOTOGRAPHIC IMPRESSIONS.</h3>

<p>Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Giles Langdell</span>, and <span class="smcap">Marcus A. Root</span>,
of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, have invented a
new and improved mode of coloring daguerreotype and other photographic
portraits or pictures made on glass, metal or other material;
and we do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact
description:&mdash;</p>

<p>The nature of our invention or discovery consists in providing
and applying both mineral and vegetable coloring matters in solution
to the daguerreotype or any other photographic impression, introducing
the said coloring matter either into the collodion or the
developer, or by pouring upon the plate after the impression is fixed
by hyposulphite of soda, or the cyanide of potassium, or by any
other means.</p>

<p>The several coloring substances, E. G. red saunders, alkanet,
dragons' blood, &amp;c., &amp;c., can be used separately or in conjunction
or compounded with various mineral substances, or with any coloring
matters obtained from other roots, woods, gums or other vegetable
matter, the proportions or quantity employed being varied
or regulated by the lightness or depth and strength of tone which
may, from time to time, be required.</p>

<p>The desired or similar results may be obtained from different
formulæ. The following answers for all practical purposes, but
may be varied at pleasure:&mdash;</p>

<p>Digest for two or three days red saunders (pterocarpus santalinus)
half a pound in three pints of water to which the aqua-ammonia
has been added. Then pour off the solution and precipitate by the
addition of nitric acid. Wash the precipitate thoroughly with water
and dry it. Then dissolve it in strong alcohol and dilute with
the same as required to produce the tone or tint that may be desired.
Alkanet (anchusa tinctoria) may be prepared in the same
way. Dragons' blood dissolved in alcohol and treated in the same
manner will produce the various shades of yellow. The foregoing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[-186-]</a></span>
articles, and also madder, indigo, cochineal, and some other coloring
substances both vegetable and mineral alone or combined, will
produce pleasing results when applied as follows (although they
may be introduced into the collodion):&mdash;</p>

<p>We prefer first to develope the impression, then to fix and dry
it, and afterwards to flow on the toning or tinting solution, as collodion
or varnish, &amp;c., is poured upon the plate, allowing the solution
to run off the corner, and then levelling the plate to make the
fluid flow uniformly over and tint the whole surface of the plate
evenly.</p>

<p>Then wash at once and thoroughly with clean water, and stand
the plate up to dry, after which it may be colored (the dress of any
tint or color desired&mdash;the face, hands, &amp;c., are flesh tint) with dry
colors (as is usual in coloring daguerreotypes) applied to the collodion
or upon the varnish.</p>

<p>What we claim as our invention and discovery, and desire to
secure by Letters Patent, is the application of coloring substances
or matter to Photographic impressions or pictures upon glass or
metal, or other material in the form and manner herein described.</p>

<h3>PATENT FOR THE USE OF ALBUMENIZED COLLODION.</h3>

<p><i>To all whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it remembered, that I, <span class="smcap">Victor M. Griswold</span>, of the
City of Lancaster, in the County of Fairfield and State of Ohio,
have invented certain improvements in the art and mode of taking
Photographic Pictures, and I do hereby declare that the following
is a full and exact description thereof:</p>

<p>The nature of my invention consists in an improvement in the
photographic art of taking pictures. To one quart of collodion prepared
in the usual way or manner, I add three ounces of a solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[-187-]</a></span>
prepared thus: The clear solution which results from the whites
of eggs which have been well beaten, and one equal bulk of pure
soft water. When this is added to the collodion, it is thrown to
the bottom in long stringy white masses, which after a few days
impart to the liquid albuminous properties, rendering the film
closer in texture, and bringing out all the minor details more
sharply and perfectly than by the ordinary collodion, and giving to
the picture a glossy and sparkling tone, unlike any produced by
other means.</p>

<p>Another method which I frequently adopt is thus; albumen as
above, without water, to which is added iodide of potassium forty
grains; this throws down the albumen in jelly-like masses, and,
when added to the collodion, not only iodizes it, but produces the
same effect upon the collodion as by the formula above. Also,
another method: one ounce of chloroform, to which is added one
half ounce of albumen, prepared as above, iodized; this forms also
a soft semi-transparent jelly, which on being added to the collodion
produces perhaps the best effect of any of these preparations.</p>

<p>This addition of albumen also answers a far better purpose,
than any that has hitherto been employed for freeing old
samples of collodion from free iodine held in suspension by
which they can be rendered as clear and limpid as they were when
first mixed.</p>

<p>What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters
Patent is the addition of albumen to collodion in the manner and
for the purpose herein and above specified.</p>

<h3>COLORING AMBROTYPES.</h3>

<p><i>To all whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that we, <span class="smcap">D. B. Spooner</span> and <span class="smcap">H. B. Spooner</span>,
of Springfield, in the County of Hampden, in the State of Massachusetts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[-188-]</a></span>
having invented new and useful improvements in coloring
Ambrotype or Photographic Pictures on glass, and we do hereby
declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof:&mdash;</p>

<p>The nature of our invention consists, in so preparing the collodion
film containing the picture in alternate placers with gum or
other suitable material, so that when a penetrating dye or pigment,
in a solution that will penetrate the collodion film, may be deposited
on any particular portion of the picture between the collodion
film and the glass, in order to give it the requisite color properly
distributed between the face, drapery, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following is the process adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p>After the picture is thoroughly washed and dried, proceed with
a brush to cover any portion of the picture not designed to take the
color, with a solution of gum or any other substance insoluble in
the coloring solution, but soluble in any other liquid in which the
coloring matter is not soluble.</p>

<p>E. G.&mdash;Take a solution of gum arabic in water, and apply it to
a portion of the picture. Now take a solution of turmeric in
alcohol, and pour it upon the collodion surface of the picture, and
you immediately get a deposit of the coloring matter between the
collodion and the glass, the portion of the picture covered with the
gum not being penetrated by the alcohol, is protected from the
color while all other portions are colored.</p>

<p>Then, by washing the picture in water, the gum is dissolved and
washed off, and the parts uncolored may remain in their natural
state without color, or, by applying the gum solution to the portion
already colored with a part of the uncolored portion, another color
may be produced by the use of another pigment in the same manner
as before described.</p>

<p>In this manner any number of colors may be produced; or, when
a small portion only of the picture is to be colored, the whole of
the picture may be colored and dried, and then that portion which
is to retain the color may be covered with the gum solution, and
the coloring matter not protected by the gum may be extracted
with alcohol or other solvent, and the gum washed off as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[-189-]</a></span></p>

<p>The advantages of our invention consist in depositing the coloring
matter in its <i>various tints</i> on the front side of the picture between
the collodion and the glass, instead of coloring the fibre of
the collodion, or the upper side of it, as is common, which does not
show through to the positive side of the picture on account of the
opacity of the silver deposit which forms the picture.</p>

<p>We do not claim the coloring of a picture all over with a single
tint, but</p>

<p>What we claim as our invention and desire to secure by Letters
Patent, is the application of gum arabic or other equivalent material,
as set forth in the specification, for the purposes therein described,
and no other.</p>

<h3>THE COLLODIO-ALBUMEN PROCESS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">COLLODIO-ALBUMEN PROCESS.</div>

<p>This is a process, invented by Dr. Taupenot, for obtaining negatives
on glass, which bids fair to outrival all others, being easy of
manipulation, and giving results of the most exquisite minutiæ and
beauty. Glass plates, when prepared and excited by this process,
may be kept at least a fortnight before being developed, and these
plates when exposed in the frame may be developed immediately,
or kept for days before commencing this operation. Indeed it is
quite possible to prepare and excite a number of plates before leaving
home to go on a tour of twelve or fourteen days; to expose the
plates at any time or place during the journey, and bring them
home to be developed.</p>

<p>The manipulation may be said to consist of nine distinct operations.</p>

<p>1. Cleaning the plate. 2. Coating with iodized collodion. 3.
Exciting the collodion film. 4. Coating with albumen. 5. Exciting
the albumen coating. 6. Exposure in the camera. 7. Developing
the image. 8. Fixing the image. 9. Varnishing the
plate.</p>

<p>Before describing these operations, I propose to give clear directions
for preparing the necessary solutions, merely promising that,
where I have deviated from the inventor's plan, it has been after
performing careful experiments, to test the merits of the two modes
of proceeding.</p>

<p>The necessary solutions for this process are:</p>

<p>Collodion bath solution. Iodized collodion. Iodized albumen.
Albumen bath solution. Pyrogallic solution. Silver developing
solution. Fixing solution.</p>

<p>Dissolve the ounce of nitrate of silver in two ounces of the distilled
water, and the two grains of iodide of potassium in one
drachm of distilled water; mix the two solutions and shake well
together until the precipitate which is first thrown down is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[-191-]</a></span>
re-dissolved; when this takes place, add the remaining fourteen ounces
of distilled water, and the two drachms of alcohol. On the addition
of the water a turbidness ensues, which must be removed by
the solution being very carefully filtered through filtering paper;
and the filtered liquid should be clear and transparent, free
from any deposit or floating particles, and must possess a slightly
acid reaction of test-paper.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain if the solution thus prepared possesses the
necessary amount of free acid without superabundance, proceed to
test and to correct it, if necessary.</p>


<p class="tdc2"><i>Iodized Collodion,</i></p>

<p>The collodion to be used in this process must be one yielding
good <i>negative</i> pictures&mdash;that supplied by Home &amp; Thornthwaite
under the name of negative collodion answers admirably. This is
supplied either ready iodized, or the collodion and iodizing in separate
bottles. As this collodion becomes less sensitive after being
iodized a fortnight, it is advisable to iodize no more than will be
used in that time&mdash;therefore, obtain the collodion and the iodizing
solution separate, as the mode of iodizing this collodion is very
simple. Half an ounce of the iodizing solution is mixed with one
ounce and a half of collodion, and the mixture allowed to settle
twelve hours before being used; and it is even advisable to pour
off the clear solution into a perfectly clean bottle, in order to get
rid of any insoluble matter which may fall to the bottom.</p>

<p>Mix these together in a tall glass jar, or wide-mouthed bottle of
at least one pint capacity; tie a piece of paper, pierce with small
holes over the top to keep out dust; then place the whole near a
fire or other warm situation, where the temperature is not lower
than seventy degrees, or higher than ninety degrees. In a few
hours fermentation commences, which is evident by the formation
of bubbles of gas, rising through the liquid. This action continues
for five or six days; when it ceases, pour the whole on a paper-filter
contained in a funnel, underneath which must be placed a
bottle to receive the liquid as it passes through. The fluid being
of a viscid nature filters slowly, generally occupying twelve hours.</p>

<p>The filtered liquid is the "iodized albumen," which is said by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[-192-]</a></span>
Dr. Taupenot to keep good for years. It must be carefully preserved
from dust or contact with any substance, as the success of
the picture depends materially on the condition of this albumen.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> This and subsequent operations (except exposure in the camera) must
be performed in a dark room.</p></div>

<p>After the ether has evaporated, and the surface of the collodion
appears set, the plate must be laid, collodion side upwards, on a
glass dipper, and plunged with <i>one downward movement</i> into a
bath filled to within an inch of the top with collodion bath solution,
made as described at <a href="#Page_190">page 190</a>, which must be carefully filtered
through filtering paper before being used. After the plate
has been allowed to remain in the bath one minute, it is lifted out
three or four times, in order to facilitate the removal of the oily
appearance the plate now presents. When the surface appears
wetted uniformly, on being drawn out of the solution the plate is
removed from the dipper, and the excess of solution drained off, and
is then placed collodion side upwards, on a fixing stand, and distilled
or filtered rain water poured over the surface, so as to remove
as much as possible of the bath solution from the surface.
The plate is now removed from the fixing stand; the back well
washed with water, and then placed nearly upright on blotting
paper, with the face against a wall for <i>one minute</i> to drain.</p>


<p class="tdc2"><i>Coating with Albumen.</i></p>

<p>Having allowed the plate to drain one minute, place it again on
a levelling stand, with the film upwards, and pour over it as
much of the iodized albumen as the plate will hold, from
a glass measure containing not more than enough of the
albumen to coat two plates with, pour off the excess into the
measure, and again cover the plate with albumen three separate
times; ultimately drain off as much as possible of the excess of
albumen, and place the plate nearly upright against the wall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[-194-]</a></span>
with the coated side inwards, to dry, which takes place in an ordinary
temperature in about one hour.</p>

<p>In coating with albumen, the presence of air-bubbles or dust
must be guarded against. The former can be easily done by taking
care, in pouring the albumen into the measure and on the plate,
not to pour so as to generate air-bubbles in the liquid. But should
any be detected, hold the plate horizontally and give it another
coating of albumen, then incline the plate so that the bulk of the
liquid shall pass over and carry off the bubbles with the running
stream. Dust on the plate must be prevented by operating in a
room as free from this photographic enemy as possible.</p>

<p>In order to render the coating of albumen as uniform as possible,
the plate must stand to dry on two or three layers of filtering paper
and the upper surface must touch the wall at <i>one point only</i> and
not to be allowed to rest against it along its entire upper edge.</p>

<p>When the albumen coating is <i>thoroughly dry</i> (and not till then),
the plate is ready to be excited, but if more have been prepared
than are likely to be used for taking pictures on during the next
ten days or fortnight, they may be stowed away in a plate box,
ready to receive the sensitive coating at any time. The author's
experience has led him to believe that these albumenized plates
will keep good any length of time, as plates which had been coated
a month, when excited, exposed, and developed, appeared to possess
all the properties of recently prepared plates.</p>


<p class="tdc2"><i>Exciting the Albumen Coating.</i></p>

<p>Prior to the plates being excited they must be <i>thoroughly dry</i>
and free from any particles of loose dust on the surface, back, or
edge. Sufficient of the albumen bath solution, <a href="#Page_192">page 192</a>, must be
filtered through filtering paper to fill a dipping bath of the required
size, so that the plate can be immersed in it.</p>

<p>The careful filtering of the fluid is very necessary in order to
free it from any floating particles, and to separate the animal charcoal.</p>

<p>The plate is now taken and laid, albumen side upwards, on the
dipper, and then lowered into the bath with one steady downward
movement, where it is allowed to remain one minute; it is then
taken out, the excess of liquid drained off, and placed on the fixing
stand, with the albumen surface uppermost, and a stream of water
poured over it for at least one minute, so as to remove every particle
of the bath solution. This complete washing is very necessary,
in order to prevent stains in the after development, which invariably
takes place around the edges, if not thoroughly washed.
The plate having been thoroughly washed, is leaned against a wall
to dry, or if required for immediate exposure, may be dried on a
plate of heated metal or foot warmer, but in no case must the exposure
in the camera take place until the surface is thoroughly dry.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> Remarks as to the selection of the view, &amp;c., are not given, as this can
be effected by the individual taste of the operator, but care must be taken
that direct rays from the sun shall not fall on the lens or enter the camera
during the exposure of a plate.</p></div>

<p>As has been before stated, this operation may take place immediately
the plate is thoroughly dry after being excited, or a
fortnight may intervene between the excitement and exposure,
provided the plate is kept very carefully excluded from light and
any chemical or sulphurous vapors, in a plate-box adapted for that
purpose, with the sensitive surface towards the back of the box.
When the exposure is about to take place, or at any time previously,
the camera-backs may each have a plate placed in them ready for
exposure; to do this, the camera-back must be taken into the operating
room and the door closed, so as to exclude all white light.
The hinged flap of the camera back is opened, and the prepared
plate laid, with its sensitive surface downwards, or next the sliding
flap, so that its corners may rest on the silver wire corners of the
plate frame previously placed within the camera back ready to receive
it. The hinged flap is now closed and kept from opening by
turning the flap button over it; the sliding flap is examined to see
that it is pushed closely down so as to guard any access of light,
and it is then ready to be placed in the camera, and may be taken
into the open air with impunity. Should the exposure not take
place immediately, or, should the camera back have to be carried
any distance, it is advisable either to wrap it up in black cloth, or
secure the flaps from the chance of coming open during transit,
by a stout string being tied around the back.</p>

<p>The focussing is conducted in the usual way and the cap replaced
on the lens; the focussing glass is now removed and the
camera back fitted into the same aperture, with the sliding flap
next the lens. The sliding flap is pulled up to its fullest extent,
placing the hand on the camera back to prevent it rising out of
the camera with this action. The cap of the lens is then removed,
so that the light may be admitted into the camera, and
to fall on the sensitive surface of the plate. After the necessary
time of exposure has taken place, the cap is replaced on the lens,
the sliding flap is pushed down, and the camera back withdrawn
from the camera; the plate can then be taken into the operating
room to be developed, or this operation may be deferred for days
or even a week, or more if convenient. The time of exposure in
the camera varies according to the intensity of the light and the
aperture and focal length of the lens; therefore, to give the exact
time of exposure would be impossible, still it may assist the amateur
if I give the time required in summer with full sunshine, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[-196-]</a></span>
merely state that this time may be increased to double in winter
or dull weather.</p>

<p>In the ordinary sunshine of a summer's day the time of exposure
will be:</p>

<p class="tdc2"><i>Developing the Image.</i></p>

<p>The camera back is taken into the operating room, from which
all white light is carefully excluded, the plate removed from the
camera back, and laid, albumen side upwards, on the fixing
stand; as much distilled water is now poured on it as the surface
will hold, taking care that every part of the sensitive surface
is covered with the liquid; allow the water to remain on
the surface for one minute, then pour off and drain slightly;
replace the plate on the stand, and pour over the surface so as
thoroughly to cover every part, the pyrogallic solution (made as
described at <a href="#Page_192">page 192</a>, and carefully filtered just before being
used); allow this to remain on the plate for one minute, then
drain off into a perfectly clean measure, and add to it an equal
bulk of silver developing solution, <a href="#Page_192">page 192</a>; mix these thoroughly
together with a glass rod, and then pour the mixed liquids over
the plate; allow them to rest until the picture begins to appear,
which generally takes about from three to five minutes; then pour
off and on repeatedly, until the developing fluid becomes opaque,
which then contains floating particles, and these, if allowed to do
so, would settle on the plate, to the injury of the picture; but this
may be prevented by brushing the surface with a camel's-hair
brush frequently during the development. When this opacity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[-197-]</a></span>
the developing fluid takes place, drain all the fluid off the plate,
and thoroughly wash with water; then mix another quantity of
pyrogallic and silver developing solution in the same proportions
as before, and pour this on and off the plate as before, until the
picture appears sufficiently intense, and the middle shades well
brought out; when this takes place drain off, and wash with water,
so as to clean the surface thoroughly, and the plate is then ready
for the next step, "fixing the image."</p>

<p>Should the picture begin to develope in less than three minutes
after the application of the mixed developing fluids, thoroughly
drain the plate, and wash well with water, then continue the development
with a solution of three parts pyrogallic solution and
one part silver developing solution; but should the picture not
begin to appear in five minutes, the addition of half a drachm of
the albumen bath solution to each ounce of mixed developing solution
will be necessary, in order to obtain the middle shades and
the required intensity. It may be stated, as a guide, that the best
negatives which the author has produced occupied from ten to
twelve minutes in developing.</p>


<p class="tdc2"><i>Fixing the Image.</i></p>

<p>The plate, having been thoroughly freed from the developing
fluid by careful washing, is now placed on the fixing stand, and the
surface covered by the fixing solution, made as described at page
192, being poured over it. In a few seconds the yellow opalescent
color of the film will begin to disappear, and its complete removal
may be hastened by blowing gently on the plate, so as to disturb
the fluid.</p>

<p>When every particle of yellowness has disappeared, the fixing
solution is drained off, and the surface <i>thoroughly</i> washed, and it
is then leaned against the wall to drain and dry.</p>


<p class="tdc2"><i>Varnishing the Plate.</i></p>

<p>The plate, being thoroughly dry, is ready to receive a coating of
transparent varnish.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> in order to protect the albumen surface from
injury during the printing process. To do this effectually the
plate must be held before a fire, or over a lamp, until it is slightly
warm all over; then pour over its surface the negative varnish, in
the same manner as collodion is applied; allow the superfluous
varnish to drain back into the bottle; hold the plate again before
the fire until the whole of the spirit is evaporated; and, when
cold, the plate is ready to be printed from, so as to produce any
number of positive pictures on paper.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> Humphrey's Collodion Gilding is the best for this purpose.</p></div>

<p>It will be observed, that in describing this process, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[-198-]</a></span>
operator has been supposed to be so situated, that in case a second
view of the same spot were required, he could return to his operating
room, remove the plate which had been exposed, from the
camera back to the plate box, and place another in the camera
back, ready for taking another view. But, unfortunately, this is
not at all times practicable. We, therefore, require some means
of removing the plates, after being exposed, from the camera back
into the plate box, and substituting others in their stead, whilst
we are in the open air.</p>

<p>In order to effect this, the "field plate box" has been devised
by the author, by the aid of which the plates may be removed
from the box, exposed in the camera, and again returned into the
box, without any possibility of access of light falling on it.</p>

<p>This box is but a trifle larger than the ordinary one, and is
furnished with two sliding bottoms, working in grooves, one over
the other; the lower bottom has a grooved channel, into which
the side of the camera back slides; the camera back has an
aperture through the side, closed by a narrow slide, and the lower
bottom of the field box has a corresponding one. We now suppose
the field box to have been previously filled with excited glass
plates, having their sensitive sides towards the back of the box,
and the box lid closed. The bottom slide is now pushed on until
the aperture is in a line with any particular groove of the field
box (which position is indicated by a numbered scale and index
point). The camera back is then slid on to its place on the field
box, so that the hinged flap is towards the front of the box, and its
narrow slide drawn out. The upper slide is then withdrawn, and
the box inclined, so that the plate in that groove opposite the aperture
in the lower slide, may pass through into the camera back.
When this has taken place, push in the narrow slide of the camera
back, invert the box, and push in the inner slide; then withdraw
the camera back from its channel, and expose the plate in the camera.
When this is done, slide the back again into its channel,
draw out the inner box slide, then the narrow camera back slide,
invert the box, and the plate will then leave the camera back and
pass into the field box, occupying the same groove as before.</p>

<p>In order to get out another plate, slide the lower bottom, so
that the index points to the number on the scale, as that of the
groove in which the required plate is situate. Then proceed as
before directed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">On a mode of Printing enlarged and reduced Positives,
etc., from Collodion Negatives.</span></p>

<p>To explain the manner in which a photograph may be enlarged
or reduced in the process of printing, it will be necessary to refer
to the remarks made at <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>, on the <i>conjugate foci</i> of lenses.</p>

<p>If a collodion negative be placed at a certain distance in front of
a camera, and (by using a tube of black cloth) the light be
admitted into the dark chamber only through the negative, a reduced
image will be formed upon the ground glass; but if the
negative be advanced nearer, the image will increase in size, until
it becomes first equal to, and then larger than, the original negative;
the focus becoming more and more distant from the lens, or
<i>receding</i>, as the negative is brought nearer.</p>

<p>Again, if a negative portrait be placed in the camera slide, and
if the instrument be carried into a dark room, a hole be cut in the
window-shutter so as to admit light through the negative, the
luminous rays, after refraction by the lens, will form an image of
the exact size of life upon a white screen placed in the position
originally occupied by the sitter. These two planes, in fact, that
of the object and of the image, are strictly <i>conjugate foci</i>, and, as
regards the result, it is immaterial from which of the two, anterior
or posterior, the rays of light proceed.</p>

<p>Therefore in order to obtain a reduced or enlarged copy of a negative,
it is necessary only to form an image of the size required,
and to project the image upon a sensitive surface either of collodion
or paper.</p>

<p>A good arrangement for this purpose may be made by taking an
ordinary portrait camera, and prolonging it in front by a deal box
blackened inside and with a double body, to admit of being
lengthened out as required; or, more simply, by adding a framework
of wood covered in with black cloth. A groove in front carries
the negative, or receives the slide containing the sensitive
layer, as the case may be.</p>

<p>In reducing photographs, the negative is placed in front of the
lens, in the position ordinarily occupied by the object; but in making
an enlarged copy it must be fixed behind the lens, or, which is
equivalent, the lens must be turned round so that the rays of light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[-200-]</a></span>
transmitted by the negative, enter the back glass of the combination,
and pass out at the front. This point should be attended to
in order to avoid indistinctness of image from spherical aberration.</p>

<p>A portrait combination of lenses of 2&frac12; or 3&frac14; inches is the best form
to use, and the actinic and luminous foci should accurately correspond,
as any difference between them would be increased by enlarging.
A stop of an inch or an inch and a half aperture placed
between the lenses obviates to some extent the loss of sharp outline
usually following enlargement of the image.</p>

<p>The light may be admitted through the negative by pointing the
camera towards the sky; or direct sunlight may be used, thrown
upon the negative by a plane reflector. A common swing looking-glass,
if clear and free from specks, does very well; it should be
so placed that the centre on which it turns is on a level with the
axis of the lens.</p>

<p>The best negatives for printing enlarged positives are those which
are distinct and clear; and it is important to use a small negative,
which strains the lens less and gives better results than one of
larger size. In printing by 2&frac14; lens for instance, prepare the negative
upon a plate about two inches square and afterwards enlarge
it four diameters.</p>

<p>Paper containing chloride of silver is not sufficiently sensitive to
receive the image, and the print should be formed upon collodion,
or on iodized paper developed by gallic acid.</p>

<p>The exposure required will vary not only with the intensity of
the light and the sensibility of the surface used, but also with the
degree of reduction or enlargement of the image.</p>

<p>In printing upon collodion the resulting picture is positive by
transmitted light; it should be backed up with white varnish, and
then becomes positive by reflected light. The tone of the blacks
is improved by treating the plate first with bichloride of mercury,
and then with ammonia.</p>

<p>Mr. Wenham, who has written a most practical paper on the
mode of obtaining positives of the life size, operates in the following
way:&mdash;he places the camera, with the slide containing the negative
in a dark room, and reflects the sunlight in through a hole
in the shutter, so as to pass first through the negative and then
through the lens; the image is received upon iodized paper, and
developed by gallic acid.</p>

<p><i>On Printing Collodion Transparencies for the Stereoscope.</i>&mdash;This
may be done by using the camera to form an image of the negative
in the mode described at the last page; but more simply by
the following process:&mdash;Coat the glass, upon which the print is to
be formed, with collodio-iodide of silver in the usual way, then lay
it upon a piece of black cloth, collodion side uppermost, and place
two strips of paper of about the thickness of cardboard and one-fourth
of an inch broad, along the two opposite edges, to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[-201-]</a></span>
the negative being soiled by contact with the film. Both glasses
must be perfectly flat, and even then it may happen that the negative
is unavoidably wetted; if so, wash it immediately with water,
and if it be properly varnished no harm will result.</p>

<p>A little ingenuity will suggest a simple framework of wood, on
which the negative and sensitive plate are retained, separated only
by the thickness of a sheet of paper; and the use of this will be
better than holding the combination in the hand.</p>

<p>The printing is conducted by the light of gas or of a camphine or
moderator lamp, diffused daylight would be too powerful.</p>

<p>The employment of a concave reflector, which maybe purchased
for a few shillings, ensures parallelism of rays, and is a great improvement.
The lamp is placed in the focus of the mirror, which
may at once be ascertained by moving it backwards and forwards
until an <i>evenly illuminated circle</i> is thrown upon a white screen
held in front. This in fact is one of the disadvantages of printing
by a naked flame&mdash;that the light falls most powerfully upon the
central part; and less so upon the edges, of the negative.</p>

<p class="tdc">(From Humphrey's Journal, No. 17, Vol. 8.)</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">On the Use of Alcohol for Sensitizing Paper.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TO SENSITIZE PAPER.</div>


<p>I have practised for some time the following simple method,
which appears to me to be very superior for cleanliness and celerity
in working, for depth of tone, and especially for purity of white
in its results. By means of it T have produced very satisfactory results
upon paper which was otherwise nearly worthless.</p>

<p>To your sensitizing solution (which should be not less than 60
grains to the ounce), whether simple nitrate or ammonio-nitrate,
add 50 per cent, of alcohol. Float the paper upon the solution for
40 seconds.</p>

<p>This method answers equally well for albumenized or plain
paper. You will find that the solution penetrates the paper which
flattens <i>instantaneously</i> upon it. It becomes as transparent as
though it were oiled, and every minute air-bubble or defect in the
paper is rendered visible. Remove the air-bubbles by pressing
upon the paper about an inch from the bubble, and thus driving
it out under the paper. In doing this, if the solution flows partially
over the back of the paper, shake it until the paper is wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[-202-]</a></span>
immersed, which will prevent any unevenness in printing. The
paper reassumes its transparency in the toning bath, but it will
dry a pure white. The sensitising solution will not become materially
discolored even after frequent applications of albumenized
paper. Should it become so much discolored as to give a dark hue
to the paper, shake it in a bottle with two drachms Of animal
charcoal and leave it a night to settle. It will filter clear. A
very small portion of your solution may be made available in sensitizing
a sheet of paper by pouring it upon a clean glass, the size
of the paper or a little larger, which is carefully levelled and
nicely laying down the paper upon it. This is useful when your
solution is too small to float in your trays. The alcohol causes it
to flow and be absorbed with perfect evenness.</p>

<p>To remove the papers from the solution and dry them:&mdash;Provide
a dozen or more clothes-pins, of the kind that are supplied
with a ring of india-rubber for a spring. Into the top drive a pin
firmly and bend it to a hook. Lift a corner of the paper by passing
under it the point of a quill tooth-pick, and attach to it one of
the clothes-pins; lift the edge out by this, and attach another to
the other corner. You may thus carry the sheet by the pins and
hang it upon a line to dry without touching it with the fingers, a
matter of some importance to Amateurs of the art, who must have
unstained hands for their day's <i>business</i>.</p>

<p>It may be worth while here to add the following simple and economical
method of printing, which I have found to surpass in convenience
and afford all the advantages of the most expensive
printing frames. Four common clothes-pins, such as work with a
<i>wire</i> spring supply pressure enough for a <sup>4</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-plate. Lay your prepared
paper upon the negative, and next to it about twenty <i>separate
leaves</i> of thin common wrapping paper cut to the size of the
negative; next a sheet of tolerably stiff and smooth writing paper,
and lastly, a piece of glass as a back to the whole. Let the glass
back be pushed from the lower edge of the papers about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> of
an inch, or just so far as to enable you to pinch the negative and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[-203-]</a></span>
papers with the thumb-nail and forefinger. Attach a pin to each
corner and your negative is prepared for exposure. Now, to examine
your picture without endangering its displacement:&mdash;remove
the pins from one end, and place it, face downwards, on a table,
the other end with pins attached projecting an inch beyond the
edge. Hold down the back glass with the left hand, while with
the right you remove the pins and pinch the papers and negative
together between the forefinger and thumb-nail. Upon the
smooth sheet of paper you can easily slide the back glass an inch
from the edge. Hold it there, and on the uncovered margin attach
<i>three</i> of the pins with as deep a bite as they will take. You may
now examine your picture to within an inch of its margin, as you
would turn over the leaves of a book. To replace the back, lay it
again on the table and slide the back glass up to the pins before
you remove them. The rest of the process is obvious.</p>

<p>The minutiæ of my communication may excite a smile with
some, but I shall always act upon the principle, that nothing is
more out of place than an apology for minuteness in describing
manipulations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECOVERY OF WASTE SILVER, ETC.</div>


<p>The manner for separating metallic silver from waste solutions
varies according to the presence or absence of alkaline hyposulphite
and cyanides.</p>

<p>a. <i>Separation of metallic Silver from old Nitrate Baths.</i>&mdash;The
silver contained in solutions of the nitrate, acetate, etc.; may easily
be precipitated by suspending a strip of sheet copper in the liquid;
the action is completed in two or three days, the whole of the nitric
acid and oxygen passing to the copper, and forming a blue solution
of the nitrate of copper. The metallic silver however separated
in this manner, always contains a portion of copper, and gives a
blue solution when dissolved in nitric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[-204-]</a></span></p>

<p>A better process is to commence by precipitating the silver
entirely in the form of <i>chloride of silver</i>, by adding common salt
until no further milkiness can be produced. If the liquid is well
stirred, the chloride of silver sinks to the bottom, and may be
washed by repeatedly filling the vessel with common water, and
pouring off the upper clear portion when the clots have again settled
down. The chloride of silver thus formed may afterwards be
reduced to metallic silver by a process which will presently be described.</p>

<p>b. <i>Separation of Silver from solutions containing alkaline Hyposulphites,
Cyanides or Iodides.</i>&mdash;In this case the silver cannot
be precipitated by adding chloride of sodium, since the chloride of
silver is <i>soluble</i> in such liquids. Therefore it is necessary to use
the sulphuretted hydrogen, or the hydrosulphate of ammonia, and
to separate the silver in the form of <i>sulphuret</i>.</p>

<p>Sulphuretted hydrogen gas is readily prepared, by fitting a cork
and flexible tubing to the neck of a pint bottle, and having introduced
<i>sulphuret of iron</i> (sold by operative chemists for the purpose),
about as much as will stand in the palm of the hand, pouring upon
it 1&frac12; fluid ounces of oil of vitriol diluted with 10 ounces of water.
The gas is generated gradually without the application of heat; and
must be allowed to bubble up through the liquid from which the
silver is to be separated. The smell of sulphuretted hydrogen being
offensive, and highly poisonous if inhaled in a concentrated form,
the operation must be carried on in the open air, or in a place where
the fumes may escape without doing injury.</p>

<p>When the liquid begins to acquire a strong and persistent odor of
sulphuretted hydrogen, the precipitation of sulphuret is completed.
The black mass must therefore be collected upon a filter, and
washed by pouring water over it, until the liquid which runs
through gives little or no precipitation with a drop of nitrate of
silver.</p>

<p>The silver may also be separated in the form of sulphuret from
old hypo baths, by adding oil of vitriol in quantity sufficient to decompose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[-205-]</a></span>
the hyposulphite of soda; and burning off the free sulphur
from the brown deposit.</p>

<p><i>Conversion of Sulphuret of Silver into Metallic Silver.</i>&mdash;The
black sulphuret of silver may be reduced to the state of metal by
roasting and subsequent fusion with carbonate of soda; but it is
more convenient, in operating on a small scale, to proceed in the
following manner:&mdash;first convert the sulphuret into nitrate of silver,
by boiling with nitric acid diluted with two parts of water;
when all evolution of red fumes has ceased, the liquid may be diluted,
allowed to cool, and filtered from the insoluble portion, which
consists principally of sulphur, but also contains a mixture of chloride
and sulphuret of silver, unless the nitric acid employed was
free from chlorine; this precipitate may be heated in order to volatilize
the sulphur, and then digested with hyposulphite of soda, or
added to the hypo bath.</p>

<p>The solution of nitrate of silver obtained by dissolving sulphuret
of silver is always strongly acid with nitric acid, and also contains
<i>sulphate</i> of silver. It may be crystallized by evaporation; but
unless the quantity of material operated on is large, it will be
better to precipitate the silver in the form of chloride, by adding
common salt, as already recommended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE USE OF TEST PAPERS.</div>


<p>The nature of the coloring matter which is employed in the
preparation of litmus-paper has already been described at <a href="#Page_98">page 98</a>.</p>

<p>In testing for the alkalies and basic oxides generally, the blue
litmus-paper which has been reddened by an acid may be used,
or, in place of it, the turmeric paper. Turmeric is a yellow vegetable
substance which possesses the property of becoming brown
when treated with an alkali; it is however decidedly less sensitive
than the reddened litmus, and is scarcely affected by the weaker
bases, such as oxide of silver.</p>

<p>In using test papers observe the following precautions:&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[-206-]</a></span>
should be kept in a dark place, and protected from the action of
the air, or they soon become purple from carbonic acid, always
present in the atmosphere in small quantity. By immersion in
water containing about one drop of liquor potassæ in four ounces,
the blue color is restored.</p>

<p>Test-papers prepared with porous paper show the red color better
than those upon glazed or strongly sized paper. If the quantity
of acid present however is small, it is not sufficient in any
case simply to dip the paper in the liquid; a small strip should
be thrown in, and allowed to remain for ten minutes or a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>If the paper, on immersion, assumes a <i>wine-red</i> or purple tint,
in place of a decided red, it is probably caused by carbonic aid
gas: in that case the blue color returns when the paper is washed
and held to the fire.</p>

<p>Blue litmus-papers may be changed to the red papers used for
alkalies by soaking in water acidified with sulphuric acid, one drop
to half a pint.</p>

<p>If distilled water cannot be procured, rain water or even common
spring water<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> will answer the purpose. To obtain the albumen,
use new-laid eggs, and be careful that in opening the shell
the yelk is not broken; each egg will yield about one fluid ounce
of albumen.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> If the water contained much sulphate of lime, it is likely that the
sensitiveness of the paper would be impaired (?).</p></div>

<p>When the ingredients are mixed, take a bundle of quills or a
fork, and beat the whole into a perfect froth. As the froth forms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[-207-]</a></span>
it is to be skimmed off and placed in a flat dish to subside. The
success of the operation depends entirely upon the manner in
which this part of the process is conducted; if the albumen is
not thoroughly beaten, flakes of animal membrane will be left in
the liquid, and will cause streaks upon the paper. When the
froth has partially subsided, transfer it to a tall and narrow jar,
and allow to stand for several hours, that the membranous shreds
may settle to the bottom. Pour off the upper clear portion, which
is fit for use. Albumenous liquids are too glutinous to run well
through a paper filter, and are better cleared by subsidence.</p>

<p>A more simple plan than the above, and one equally efficacious,
is to fill a bottle to about three parts with the salted mixture of
albumen and water, and to shake it well for ten minutes or a quarter
of an hour, until it loses its glutinosity and can be poured out
smoothly from the neck of the bottle. It is then to be transferred
to an open jar, and allowed to settle as before.</p>

<p>The solution, prepared by the above directions, will contain exactly
ten grains of salt to the ounce, dissolved in an equal bulk of
albumen and water. Some operators employ the albumen alone
without an addition of water, but the paper in that case has a very
highly varnished appearance, which is thought by most to be objectionable.</p>

<p>The principal difficulty in albumenizing paper is to avoid the
occurrence of streaky lines, which, when the paper is rendered sensitive,
bronze strongly under the influence of the light. The writer
believes these to be caused by a commencing decomposition of the
animal matter composing the cells in which the albumen is retained
and the best remedy appears to be to use the eggs quite fresh; the
same object may sometimes (but not invariably) be attained by
allowing the albumen to stand for several weeks until it has become
sour; after which it will be sufficiently limpid to run through
a filter.</p>

<p>In salting and albumenizing photographic paper by the formula
above given, it was found that each quarter sheet, measuring
eleven by nine inches, removed one fluid drachm and a half from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[-208-]</a></span>
the bath; equivalent to about one grain and three quarters of salt
(including droppings). In salting plain paper, each quarter sheet
took up only one drachm; so that the glutinous nature of the albumen
causes a third part more of the salt to be retained by the
paper.</p>

<p><i>Selection of the Paper.</i>&mdash;The English papers are not good for albumenizing;
they are too dense to take the albumen properly, and
curl up when laid upon the liquid; the process of toning the prints
is also slow and tedious. The thin negative paper of Canson, the
Papier Rieve, and Papier Saxe, have succeeded with the writer
better than Canson's positive paper, which is usually recommended;
they have a finer texture and give more smoothness of grain.</p>

<p>To apply the albumen; pour a portion of the solution into a flat
dish to the depth of half an inch. Then, having previously cut
the paper to the proper size, take a sheet by the two corners, bend
it into a curved form, convexity downwards, and lay it upon the
albumen, the centre part first touching the liquid and the corners
being lowered gradually. In this way all bubbles of air will be
pushed forwards and excluded. One side only of the paper is wetted:
the other remains dry. Allow the sheet to rest upon the solution
for one minute and a half, and then raise it off, and up by
two corners. If any circular spots, free from albumen, are seen,
caused by bubbles of air, replace the sheet for the same length of
time as at first.</p>

<p>The paper must not allowed to remain upon the salting bath
much longer than the time specified, because the solution of albumen
being <i>alkaline</i> (as is shown by the strong smell of ammonia
evolved on the addition of the chloride of ammonium), tends to remove
the size from the paper and sink in too deeply; thus losing
its surface gloss.</p>

<p>Albumenized paper will keep a long time in a dry place. Some
have recommended to press it with a heated iron, in order to coagulate
the layer of albumen upon the surface; but this precaution
is unnecessary, since the coagulation is perfectly affected by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[-209-]</a></span>
nitrate of silver used in the sensitizing; and it is doubtful whether
a layer of dry albumen would admit of coagulation by the simple
application of a heated iron.</p>

<p><i>To render the paper sensitive.</i>&mdash;This operation must be conducted
by the light of a candle, or by yellow light. Take of</p>

<p>Prepare a sufficient quantity of this solution, and lay the sheet
upon it in the same manner as before. Three minutes' contact will
be sufficient with the thin negative paper, but if the Canson positive
paper is used, lour or five minutes must be allowed for the
decomposition. The papers are raised from this solution by a pair
of bone forceps or common tweezers tipped with sealing-wax; or
a pin may be used to lift up the corner, which is then taken by the
finger and thumb and allowed to drain a little before again putting
in the pin, otherwise a white mark will be produced upon the paper,
from decomposition of the nitrate of silver. When the sheet
is hung up, a small strip of blotting-paper suspended from the lower
edge of the paper will serve to drain off the last drop of liquid.</p>

<p>The solution of nitrate of silver becomes after a time discolored
by the albumen, but may be used for sensitizing until it is nearly
black. The color can be removed by animal charcoal,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> but a
better plan is to use the "kaolin" or pure white china clay. The
writer has also tried the common "pipe-clay," which answered
perfectly, but appeared to injure the sensitiveness of paper subsequently
floated upon the bath (?).</p>

keep for several days, if protected from the light, but afterwards
turns yellow from partial decomposition.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
